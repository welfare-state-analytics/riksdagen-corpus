        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>Parliamentary proceedings corpora (PPCs) are a quintessential resource for a wide
        range of research questions from a number of SSH disciplines, such as history and
	sociolinguistics. Their most distinguishing
        characteristic is that they are (typically edited) transcriptions of spoken
        language produced in controlled and regulated circumstances. They are also rich in
        invaluable (sociodemographic) metadata as well as easily available under the Freedom
        of Information Acts set in place to enable informed participation by the public and
        to improve effective functioning of democratic systems, making the datasets even more
        valuable.</p>
        
        <p>Given these reasons and the fact that parliamentary proceedings are often
        available on-line, many researchers have already compiled corpora of parliamentary
        proceedings.  However, these corpora are encoded in a variety of different annotation
        schemes, limiting their interchange and re-use.</p>
        
        <p>In order to overcome this problem, the presented recommendations, called
        Parla-CLARIN, propose a schema that can be used for encoding of parliamentary
        proceedings corpora, primarily for the purposes of scholarly investigations,
        and that could serve as a storage and interchange format for such corpora. These
        recommendations attempt to take into account the following aspects of PPC:
        <list>
          <item>Structure: legislative periods, sessions, topics, speeches, transcription variants</item>
          <item>Metadata: mandates, titles, parliamentary bodies, locations, dates
          and times</item>
          <item>Speakers: sex, date of birth, education, party membership, links to external
          resources</item>
          <item>Political parties: name(s), history, relations</item>
          <item>Speeches: speaker, text, comments, verbal interruptions, (non-)verbal incidents</item>
          <item>Linguistic annotation: PoS tagging, normalisation, syntax etc.</item>
          <item>Multimedia: audio and video, facsimile of original</item>
        </list>
        </p>
        
        <p>The recommendations are implemented as a parameterisation of the
        <ref target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html">TEI
        Guidelines</ref>, which are XML-based recommendations for encoding texts for scholarly
        purposes. As opposed to most other such recommendations, the TEI Guidelines have the
        ambition to be applicable to texts in any natural language, of any date, in any
        literary genre or text type, without restriction on form or content. The TEI
        parameterisation proposed for Parla-CLARIN also allows a wide range of PPC to be encoded,
        while making explicit recommendations on the manner of encoding various
        phenomena. The recommendations are written as a TEI ODD document, on the
        basis of which it is possible to derive an XML schema expressed either as a RelaxNG
        schema, a DTD or a W3C schema.</p>

        <p>When using these recommendations, the following points should be taken in consideration:
        <list>

          <item>The TEI Guidelines are a large and complex set of specifications, and the
          Parla-CLARIN recommendations do not attempt to give an introduction to them. Rather,
          it concentrates only on aspects of the Guidelines that are most likely to be of use
          in encoding PPCs.</item>
          
          <item>It is difficult if not impossible to determine in advance what research
          questions a developer of a PPC will want to ask, and so what kind of phenomena they
          will want to encode. While we tried to cater for the more obvious encoding needs, it
          is possible that new users will have to use TEI elements or attributes that are not
          mentioned here.</item>

          <item>Since these recommendations are very much work in progress, we have left the formal
          specification (i.e. the XML schema) rather unconstrained, so it can accommodate
          encoding practices that we have not (yet) foreseen. The downside of this is that the
          XML schemas will allow constructs that are at odds to those that we propose in the
          prose of the recommendations. Therefore, the prose should be taken as the definitive
          way of encoding the phenomena under discussion, i.e. even if a PPC validates against
          the schema, it might still not be encoded according to these recommendations.</item>

          <item>In the text of these recommendations, every mention of an element is linked to
          its definition, where examples of use are also given. The text also makes frequent
          reference to the text of the TEI Guidelines. However, the TEI
          Guidelines give generic examples and explanations, which can be at odds with 
          particular recommendations that are made here, so the ones from the TEI Guidelines
	  should be taken with a grain of salt.</item>

        </list>
        </p>
        
        <p>The rest of these recommendations are structured as follows:

      <div xml:id="sec-scope">
          <head>Scope and purpose</head>
          <p>These recommendations consists of guidelines, a formal TEI schema, and derived
          XML schemas in various schema languages. Theye are intended for the encoding of
          corpora of parliamentary proceedings, regardless of the language or country of
          origin, for the purposes of scholarly investigations, be they from the field of
          linguistics, political science, history or other humanities and social sciences
          disciplines. The recommendations are, in principle, not meant as the primary
          storage format of parliamentary proceedings, such as kept by governmental
          offices, for which <ref target="#sec-akoma">Akoma Ntoso</ref> might be 
          preferred.</p>
          
          <p>In developing a schema for structuring data, two approaches can be adopted: a
          descriptive one, where as much as possible of the original data distinctions are kept
          in the target encoding; or a prescriptive one, where the target encoding is severely
          constrained, to enable seamless data interchange and esp. interoperability with
          software tools. The Parla-CLARIN recommendations adopt the <emph>descriptive</emph>
          approach, as the source data, time and effort devoted to converting it, the intended
          applications, as well as country-specific rules of parliamentary proceedings will
          differ considerably, and it is likely that any prescriptive schema would soon turn
          out to be too restrictive. Nevertheless, the recommendations do try to limit the
          plethora of encoding options otherwise available in TEI to those that could be
          sensibly applied to corpora of parliamentary proceedings, and where more than one
          option is available in TEI to encode a given phenomenon, the schema and especially
          the text guidelines attempt to recommend only one option.</p>

            <p>The Parla-CLARIN proposal is developed as a project of the <ref
            target="https://www.clarin.eu/">CLARIN</ref> European Research Infrastructure for
            Language Resources and Technology. Before the beginning of this development CLARIN
            had already organised a number of initiatives and events that deal with
            parliamentary corpora:
            <list>
              <item>CLARIN Traveling Campus <q>Talk of Europe</q>, where three <q>Creative
              Camps</q> were organised in 2014 and 2015 and which used the proceedings of
              the European Parliament, curated as
              <ref target="https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-x62-ew3m">linked open data</ref></item>
              <item>CLARIN-PLUS cross-disciplinary workshop

            </list>
            At these events it became clear that existing parliamentary corpora are
            encoded in many different ways, presenting a barrier to their
            interchange. Therefore the CLARIN Interoperability Committee organised a
            focused
            <q><ref target="https://www.clarin.eu/blog/clarin-parlaformat-workshop">CLARIN
            ParlaFormat</ref></q> workshop (May 23-24, 2019, Amersfoort) with selected
            participants at which the idea of the Parla-CLARIN recommendations were introduced,
            the participants presented their own experiences with encoding parliamentary
            corpora and gave their comments to the draft proposal.

            <head>Akoma Ntoso</head>
            <p>While there are a large number of recommendations and standards that could in
            principle be used to encode parliamentary proceedings, the <ref
            target="http://www.akomantoso.org/">Akoma Ntoso</ref> standard stands out in that
            it was explicitly developed as an XML format for encoding legislative and judiciary
            documents including parliamentary proceedings. Akoma Ntoso is an OASIS standard and
            has already been used to encode various legal documents in a number of
            countries. It defines an <ref
            target="http://docs.oasis-open.org/legaldocml/akn-core/v1.0/os/part1-vocabulary/akn-core-v1.0-os-part1-vocabulary.html">XML
            schema</ref> for modelling for legal documents (called AKN), uses <ref
            target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_Requirements_for_Bibliographic_Records">FRBR
            concepts</ref> and has a built-in relation to ontologies.</p>

            <p>It is thus a reasonable question why CLARIN does not simply adopt AKN, rather
            than developing a conceptually very different parameterisation of TEI. The main
            reasons for this are the following:
            <list>
              <item>Unfamiliarity of corpus compilers and users with AKN, and relatively
              good familiarity with TEI: for example, of the 16 talks presenting PPCs at the <ref
              target="https://www.clarin.eu/event/2019/parlaformat-workshop">CLARIN ParlaFormat
              workshop</ref>, 10 used a TEI encoding, or an encoding <q>inspired by TEI</q>. It
              should also be noted that for most corpus compiler PPCs will be only one type of
              the corpora they will be compiling, so it is somewhat unrealistic for them to learn
              AKN and develop conversion scripts from it for just one type of corpus; on the
              other hand, TEI can be used for practically any type of corpora.</item>
              <item>AKN makes no provisions for storing speaker meta-data, which is rather
              accessed from external data sources and using a specialised referencing system; on
              the other hand, TEI has a number of elements for recording details about
              persons. For reasons of completeness, uniform and easier processing, and
              experimental replicability it is better to include these data directly in the
              corpus.</item>
              <item>AKN has no built-in support for linguistic annotation (apart from named
              entities). And while it would be possible to add elements for such annotation via
              a different namespace to AKN, AKN has no provisions for extending its schema,
              while TEI already has such elements available. As the main purpose of this
              proposal is to cater for linguistic analyses of parliamentary proceedings, TEI
              seems a better choice.</item>
            </list>
            Nevertheless, AKN is an important schema for modelling parliamentary proceedings,
            and some solutions of AKN were used in developing the Parla-CLARIN proposal, in
            particular the typology of divisions of a document. Also developed was a (partial)
            conversion for AKN to Parla-CLARIN, which covers some example documents, further
            discussed in the Section on the <ref target="#sec-convakn">Conversion from Akoma
            Ntoso</ref>.</p>
          </div>

        <div xml:id="sec-rdf">
          <head>RDF</head>
          <p>The Resource Description Framework (<ref
          target="https://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</ref>) is a W3C specification and a standard model
          for computer-processable data interchange on the Web. It is also the base format for
          modelling information in the context of Linked Open Data (<ref
          target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">LOD</ref>), an influential model
          for linking data on the Web. And while LOD data is typically not concerned with
          language data, there is also the <q>Linguistic Linked Open Data Cloud</q> (<ref
          target="http://linguistic-lod.org/llod-cloud">LLOD</ref>) initiative which is
          explicitly targeted towards language resources. RDF/LOD has also been quite popular
          for modelling parliamentary debates (e.g. the already mentioned <ref
          target="https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-x62-ew3m">Talk of Europe</ref> LOD dataset),
          so, again, the question arises why not use RDF to encode such data, rather than
          developing a TEI-based solution.</p>

          <p>In this case the answer is, at least partially, to do with the community addressed
          by the Parla-CLARIN recommendations and the preferences of this community: while LOD
          is targeted to computer scientists and the concept of a machine-processable and
          linked Word-Wide Web, TEI much more addresses researchers from (digital) humanities
          and of internally complete resources. In practical terms this is seen in the
          difference between RDF encoded data, which is machine processable but hardly human
          readable or editable and highly connected to external data sources, while TEI
          documents are relatively self-explanatory, esp. after some exposure to the TEI
          Guidelines, can be edited in any XML editor and mostly self-contained. And while
          there exists the LLOD initiative that addresses linguistic annotation, the initiative
          seems to have lost momentum, and also has other concerns to addressing detailed
          encoding of a particular type of language resources - in fact, the same can be said
          for most RDF attempts at encoding parliamentary data, which encode only rather
          shallow aspects of such data.</p>

          <p>But while this specification does not see RDF data as the ideal framework to
          encode parliamentary proceedings corpora for storage and interchange, it does take RDF
          as a useful down-stream model for exploiting such corpora, i.e. developing a TEI to
          RDF conversion is a concern, which it taken further in the Section on the <ref
          target="#sec-conrdf">Conversion to RDF</ref>.</p>

      <p>A Parla-CLARIN corpus should, in general, capture as much of the text and markup
      from the source as possible, while the presence of graphical items or other elements

          <p>The corpus should be encoded in Unicode, using the UTF-8 character encoding, at
          least for European languages.  In cases where the original contains characters from
          the Unicode Private Use Area, these should be given their closest Unicode
          equivalents.<note>TEI supports preserving the original Private Use Area codepoints
          by using the <gi>g</gi> element, the use of which is further explained in the Section
          on <ref

          Glyphs, and Writing Modes</ref> of the TEI Guidelines. However, such characters will
          rarely if ever be used in PPCs, so the current Parla-CLARIN proposal does not include
          the gaiji module which allows the use of this element - if they are needed, then the
          Parla-CLARIN ODD needs to be changed.</note></p>
          
          <p>End-of-line hyphens can be removed, and the split words joined in order to
          simplify linguistic processing. It is recommended that this practice is documented
          in the TEI header of the corpus, in the <gi>hyphenation</gi> element.</p>
          
          <p>Two characters, esp. prevalent when the source documents are in Word, deserve
          special mention:
          
          <list>
            <item>No-Break Space (U+00A0) prevents, with some applications, an automatic
            line break at its position and collapsing consecutive white space characters
            into a single space. As Parla-CLARIN is not interested in preserving the
            details of the layout, and the use of this character complicates (or breaks)
            further processing esp. lingistic annotation, it is recommended that this
            character is substituted by the normal space character (U+0020). The same
            holds for other variants of spaces (U+2000 - U+200A), which are, however,
            used much less frequently.</item>
            
            <item>Soft Hyphen (U+00AD) indicates that a word can be hyphenated at that
            point. Occurences of this character should be removed from the corpus,
            because they only complicate or break further processing.</item>
          </list>
          </p>
          
          <p>While not required, it is sensible to also normalise sequences of whitespace
          characters (such as tabulators, end-of-line characters and spaces) into a single
          space or end-of-line character. Again, this simplifies further (esp. linguistic)
          processing.</p>

          <p>Difficult encoding situations that are not covered by the TEI Guidelines

          particular, if the source texts has been changed (so, omitting or normalising

          this practice should be documented in the <gi>correction</gi>,

          namely <gi>segmentation</gi> and <gi>interpretation</gi> can also be used to
          document these aspects of the encoding process. The example below illustrates
          the use of these elements:

          <head>Languages</head>
          <p>The language of an element's text content is in TEI, as in XML, signaled by the
          value of its <att>xml:lang</att> attribute.  The Parla-CLARIN recommendations require
          that each element that contains text is either marked by this attribute, or one of
          its ancestors is; in particular, the root element of the corpus should have an
          <att>xml:lang</att> attribute. For multilingual documents (excluding cases where only
          a minor part of the text is in another language), the language code if the root
          element should be <q>mul</q> for <q>multiple languages</q>. Note that if, going by
          the ancestor axis, the values of two <att>xml:lang</att> are in conflict, the one
          closer to the context node is relevant one.
          </p>
          
          <p>The values of <att>xml:lang</att> should follow <ref
          target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47">BCP 47</ref>, cf. also <q><ref
          target="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-when-xmllang">xml:lang in XML
          document schemas</ref></q>.</p>
          
          <p>It is good practice to document the languages used in the <gi>langUsage</gi>
          element of the TEI header.</p>
          
          <p>Apart from the above considerations, a related question is where to draw the line
          between the object and meta languages, i.e. the language of the corpus and the
          language of the mark-up. The TEI defines the names of the elements and attributes in
          English, and the language of the corpus will, of course, depend on the country of the
          parliament. It is less straightforward to decide in which language the attribute
          values (such as the values of the <att>type</att> attribute) should be. Parla-CLARIN
          recommends that these should also be in English.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-idents">
          <head>Identifiers and referencing</head>
          <p>In order to simply refer to elements of a TEI document (i.e. a Parla-CLARIN
          corpus), elements can be marked with an ID, i.e. given the <att>xml:id</att> attribute
          with a unique value, obeying certain format requirements as defined by
          <ref target="https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-id/">W3C</ref>.</p>
          
          <p>Parla-CLARIN requires an <att>xml:id</att> attribute on the root element of
          each corpus file, which should, furthermore, be identical to the filename (modulo
          the file extension).  Parla-CLARIN also recommends that the divisions of the
          document (element <gi>div</gi>) should also be given identifiers. While any
          element can be given an <att>xml:id</att>, this is in general, not a good idea;
          rather, only those elements that will or could be referenced should be marked with
          this attribute.</p>
          
          <p>TEI offers a number of attributes that contain (URI) pointers.  Where the reference
          is to an element inside the document, the value of the <att>xml:id</att> being
          referred to should be preceded by a hash (#), as mandated by the XML standard. If the
          ID pointed to is from another document, them the full URI needs to be used.  However,
          as such URIs can be very long, TEI also offers another way of pointing, which can be
          used to shorten such long URIs, and this is defined by the <gi>prefixDef</gi> element
          in the TEI header. So, for example, if the definitions of MULTEXT-East feature
          structures are stored in the XML document
          <val>http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V6/msd/tables/msd-fslib-sl.xml</val>, while the corpus uses
          pointers to these definitions
          (e.g. <val>http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V6/msd/tables/msd-fslib-sl.xml#Pd-nsg</val>), then,
          with the appropriate definition of the prefix, we can use in the corpus much shorter
          pointers such as <val>mte:Pd-nsg</val>, which are then, via a regular expression
          mapping in the prefix definition converted to the full URI.

        <div xml:id="sec-temporal">
          <head>Temporal information</head>
          <p>Parliamentary corpora can contain significant time-related information, e.g. the
          date and time of a sitting, the start and end of an MP's affiliation to a particular
          party, the dates of the beginning and end of a political party etc. In general, such
          information in TEI is stored in the attributes of the pertinent element, which take
          as their values a date and possibly time, according to the ISO 8601 Date and Time
          Formats, and specified in the <ref target="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/">XML
          Schema Part 2: Datatypes Second Edition</ref>. TEI offers a very rich set of
          attributes and ancillary elements to specify time-related information, which are
          discussed in the Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CO.html#CONADA">Dates
          and Times</ref> of the TEI Guidelines.</p>

          <p>Parla-CLARIN users are free to use any of the TEI temporal attributes and
          elements, however, for most purposes, the following five attributes will suffice:
          <list>
            <item><att>when</att>: when a certain event happened;</item>
            <item><att>from</att>, <att>to</att>: the start and end of an event or state;</item>
            <item><att>notBefore</att>, <att>notAfter</att>: the earliest and latest known
            time that where an event or state took place, used in cases where the exact time
            is not known.</item>
          </list>

        <div xml:id="sec-files">
          <head>Files</head>
          <p>While this recommendations make the assumption that a complete PPC is one TEI XML
          document, this does not mean that it also has to be stored in one file, as the file
          structure is distinct from the concept of XML documents. To enable one XML document
          to be composed of many files, the <ref
          target="https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/">XInclude</ref> mechanism should be
          used. Typically, a corpus will then be composed of a file containing the root XML
          element and the corpus header, while individual text files will be included in the
          corpus using the <gi>include</gi> element from the XInclude namespace, as illustrated
          by the following example:

          <eg xml:id="exa-xinclude">
            <![CDATA[<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="Sk-11/SI-1990-05-07-01.xml"/>]]>
          </eg>
          </p>
          
          <p>As mentioned, we recommend that the file has the same name as the value of the
          <att>xml:id</att> attribute of the root element of the file. This e.g. guarantees
          that each file of the corpus has a unique name.</p>

          <!-- Komentar, da <teiCorpus> ni nujen -->
          
          <p>As illustrated below, a CLARIN-Parla corpus is typically rooted in a
          <gi>teiCorpus</gi> element. The <gi>teiHeader</gi> of the corpus then contains the
          metadata for the complete corpus, including the metadata that is marked with
          the <att>xml:id</att> attribute and referred to by the subordinate <gi>TEI</gi> elements,
	  such as the defined taxonomies and the list of speakers.</p>

            </teiCorpus>
          </egXML>

          <p>We do not specify what an individual <gi>TEI</gi> element should contain, as
          the size and granularity of parliamentary proceedings corpora, not to mention the
          national rules of structuring the workings of the parliament, will differ
          substantially. Typically, however, and individual <gi>TEI</gi> element would
          contain one sitting or session or one day, in any case such data that has common
          metadata that distinguishes it from the other <gi>TEI</gi> elements in the
          corpus.</p>

          <p>In cases of smaller corpora, the top level <gi>teiCorpus</gi> can also be omitted,
          so the complete corpus is rooted simply in a <gi>TEI</gi> element.</p>
          
          <p>As illustrated below, the <gi>text</gi> element can, apart from the obligatory
          <gi>body</gi>, also contain front matter in <gi>front</gi> and back matter in
          <gi>back</gi>. While the <gi>body</gi> will contain the transcription proper
          (i.e. the speeches), the former contains preamble text, and the latter various
          appendices or texts that are related to the speeches.</p>

          matter, the element that further organises the content into sections is the division,
          <gi>div</gi>, and each of the three <gi>text</gi> elements (if present) should
          contain at least one division.</p>

          <p>The divisions can be nested, as shown in the example below:

                  ...
                </div>
                <div>
                  <head>Hour of topical interest</head>
                  ...
                </div>
                <div>
                  <head>Announcement of an urgent request</head>
                  ...
                </div>
              </div>
            </body>
          </egXML>
          In general it is a complicated question what should constitute a division of a
          transcription, with the pragmatic solution being that a division will be whatever has
          a heading (than can be recognised by the up-conversion software) in the source
          transcription.</p>

          <p>The divisions can be further characterised by their <att>type</att> and, possibly,
          <att>subtype</att> attributes. The use of these attributes makes sense in cases where
          the source either explicitly (e.g. via its structure, as in Akoma Ntoso) or
          implicitly (e.g. via pattern matching the content of the headings) indicates what
          kind of a division it is. For example:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-divtype">
            <body>
              <div>
                ...
                <div type="representation">
                  <head>Representation of members of the Federal Government</head>
                  ...
                </div>
                <div type="topical">
                  <head>Hour of topical interest</head>
                  ...
                </div>
                <div type="request">
                  <head>Announcement of an urgent request</head>
                  ...
                </div>
              </div>
            </body>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          
          <p>If used, the values of the <att>type</att> and <att>subtype</att> attributes will
          depend on the parliamentary rules of the particular country, on the need to
          distinguish the types of divisions, as well as on the ability to automatically
          recognise them or the available effort to manually add them. The Parla-CLARIN
          specification does therefore not enforce the use of these attributes nor does it
          restrict their values.  However, the definition of <gi>div</gi> does give a set of
          sample values for <att>type</att>, which correspond to the names of the structure
          elements defined by <ref target="#sec-akoma">Akoma Ntoso</ref>. Below we give an
          example of a relatively complex structure made on the basis of an Akoma

          <head>Document variants</head>
          <p>Parliamentary proceedings often exist in two versions, the original,
          <q>raw</q> transcription, and the edited, <q>redacted</q> transcription, which
          is then published. If both versions can be available, it is interesting for some
          research questions to also have both versions transcriptions available for study
          in the scope of a PPC.</p>

          <p>TEI offers a number of options on how to encode variant texts, most of them
          discussed in the <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SA.htm">Chapter on
          Linking, Segmentation, and Alignment</ref>. We here present the simplest option,
          where it is assumed that each transcription exists in a separate TEI document
          and that the segments that should be aligned between the raw and redacted
          transcriptions are explicitly marked up in the text. As shown in the example
          below, which gives one segment from the file <code>trans-raw.xml</code>
          and one from the file <code>trans-red.xml</code> it is in this case
          enough to specify the <att>xml:id</att> on both elements and use the
          <att>corresp</att> attribute to point to the aligned segment:

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-variants">
            <!-- From trans-raw.xml: -->
            <seg xml:id="raw.1" corresp="trans-red.xml#red.1">What did, uh, who say that?</seg>

            <!-- From trans-red.xml: -->
            <seg xml:id="red.1" corresp="trans-raw.xml#raw.1">Who said that?</seg>
          </egXML>
          It should be noted that the relation between the aligned elements does not need
          to be 1-1: if the relation is 0-1 or 1-0, then the non-aligned element is simply
          not given in a <att>corresp</att>; if the relation is n-1 or 1-n, then several
          IDs are given as values of the <att>corresp</att> attribute,
          e.g. <code>corresp="trans-raw.xml#raw.3 trans-raw.xml#raw.4"</code>.</p>
        </div>
        
      </div>

      <div xml:id="sec-metadata">
        <head>Corpus metadata</head>
        <p>TEI allows significant metadata to be added to a document.  The metadata is
        contained in the <gi>teiHeader</gi> element, which in corpora can appear at two
        levels:
        <list>
          <item>the overall corpus teiHeader;</item>
          <item>the teiHeader of the individual corpus texts, i.e. the <gi>TEI</gi> element.</item>
        </list>
        It is recommended that the metadata that is common to the whole corpus is stored in
        the corpus TEI header, whereas the text-specific metadata is in the corpus text TEI
        header.</p>
        
        <p>It is outside the scope of this specification to give all the details of a
        <gi>teiHeader</gi> element, for this, the user is referred to the Section on the <ref
        target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html">TEI header</ref>
        of the TEI Guidelines, and, of course, to the example corpora that are part of the
        Parla-CLARIN Git repository. Here we do, however, give some examples and concentrate on
        the metadata that is esp. relevant to parliamentary proceedings corpora.</p>

        <div xml:id="sec-speakers">
          <head>Speaker metadata</head>
          <p>Unlike some other proposals, in particular Akoma Ntoso, the Parla-CLARIN recommendations
          assume that speaker meta-data is also included in the corpus,<note>Of course, this
          does not meant that links with corpus-external URIs are not allowed.</note> as
          this allows the corpus to be stand-alone with all the relevant data necessary for
          analysis already included in it.</p>
          
          <p>Information on speakers is given in the corpus TEI header, in particular in the
          <gi>listPerson</gi> element, itself a part of the participant description,
          i.e. the <gi>particDesc</gi> element.</p>

          <p>A <gi>listPerson</gi> typically contains <gi>person</gi> elements, which give
          information on an individual person, as the example below illustrates.
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-speakers">
            <person xml:id="KucanMilan1941">
              <persName>
                <surname>Kučan</surname>
                <forename>Milan</forename>
              </persName>
              <sex value="M">male</sex>
              <birth when="1941-01-14">
                <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3197229">Križevci</placeName>
              </birth>
            </person>
          </egXML>

          Each <gi>person</gi> must have an <att>xml:id</att> attribute, so that it can be
          referred to from the transcription. Apart from that, the only required element is
          <gi>persName</gi>, giving the name of the person. This can be contained directly in the element, or
	  as the preferred option, further decomposed into
          the person surname(s) and forename(s) or even other elements, as explained in the Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html#NDPER">Personal
          Names</ref> of the TEI Guidelines.</p>

          <p>As illustrated above, further person metadata can contain the sex of the person and
          their birth date and place. Other potentially useful elements are the persons
          <gi>death</gi> date and place, as well as (possibly time stamped) <gi>education</gi>,
          <gi>occupation</gi>, and <gi>affiliation</gi>.</p>

          <p>In the context of PPCs, the <gi>affiliation</gi> element is especially important, as it
          can denote the person's membership in a political party, or their role in the parliament,
          such as being an MP. Different types of affiliations are distinguished by the different
          values of the <att>role</att> attribute, such as <q>member</q> (of a party) or <q>MP</q>.
          As affiliations are not necessarily fixed, and the <gi>affiliation</gi> element can
          be marked for its temporal duration, as explained in the Section on
	  <ref target="#sec-temporal">Temporal information</ref>.
	  The example below illustrates the encoding of various affiliations.
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-affiliation">
            <person xml:id="AnderličAnton">
              <persName>
                <surname>Anderlič</surname>
                <forename>Anton</forename>
              </persName>
              <affiliation role="member" ref="#party.ZSMS" from="1990-05-08" to="1990-11-09"/>
              <affiliation role="member" ref="#party.LDS.1" from="1990-11-10" to="1994-03-11"/>
              <affiliation role="MP" ref="#DruzPolZb" from="1990-05-08" to="1992-12-22" ana="#SK.11"/>
              <affiliation role="MP" ref="#DZ" from="1992-12-23" to="1996-11-27" ana="#DZ.1"/>
	    </person>
          </egXML>
	  </p>
	  
          <p>The example above uses, via the <att>ref</att> attribute, stand-off annotation to refer
          to the names of the parties, which should then be defined in a <gi>taxonomy</gi> element in
          the <gi>teiHeader</gi>, as explained in the Section on <ref target="#sec-party">Party
          metadata</ref>. The same can done for the MP affiliation to the national assembly,
          where, additionally, a reference, via the <att>ana</att> attribute, is given to the
          legislative period in which the person was an MP.</p>

	  <p>Alternatively (or additionally), the name of the party or national assembly can also be
	  given directly in the <gi>affiliation</gi> element using the <gi>orgName</gi> element, as
	  illustrated below. The example also illustrates the additional information, encoded as an
	  subordinate <gi>affiliation</gi> with the appropriate <att>role</att>, that the person was
	  elected as an MP to represent a certain constituency, giving its name and location.
	    
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-constituency">
              <affiliation role="MP" ref="#DruzPolZb" from="1990-05-08" to="1996-11-27">
                <orgName xml:lang="sl">Državni zbor Republike Slovenije</orgName>
                <orgName xml:lang="en">National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia</orgName>
		<affiliation role="consituency">
                  <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/3194351">Novo mesto</placeName>
		</affiliation>
	      </affiliation>
          </egXML>
          </p>

          <p>Persons can have further attributes, and TEI offers various elements (typically typed)
          to express them; they are introduced in the Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html#NDPERSEpc">Personal
          Characteristics</ref> of the TEI Guidelines. The two more general ones are <gi>state</gi>,
          which contains the description of some status or quality attributed to a person (or
          organization), often at some specific time or for a specific date range and <gi>trait</gi>,
          which differs from <gi>state</gi> that it is independent of the volition or action of the
          holder and usually not at some specific time or for a specific date range. The former
          could, for example, be used to encode the fact that a PM was jailed for a given period of
          time, while the latter would e.g. be used for the information that a PM is handicapped.</p>

          <p>It is often advantageous to refer to external knowledge sources about a person, such as
          Wikipedia or VIAF. This is encoded using the <gi>idno</gi> element, whose content is
          typically an URI, while the <att>type</att> attribute denotes the kind of knowledge source
          referred to.

          <p>Information on political parties, as well as other groupings of people, such as
          ministries, is contained in the <gi>listOrg</gi> element, which is, just as
          <gi>listPerson</gi> element, contained in the <gi>particDesc</gi> element of the
          corpus TEI header. The Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html#ND-org">Organizational
          Data</ref> of the TEI Guidelines gives the particulars on how to encode data on
          organisations. An example of two <gi>org</gi> elements with a complex name
          structure and interdependencies is given below:
          
          <!-- Note that @full="init" is misused, at least according to the TEI definition -->
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-parties">

          </egXML>
          
          As with persons, each organisation must contain an <att>xml:id</att> attribute, so
          that <gi>person</gi> elements can refer to it. The fact that the organisation is a
          political party is encoded in the <att>role</att> attribute, where the suggested
          values are defined in the Parla-CLARIN schema. The name(s) of the party are given in
          the <gi>orgName</gi> element, which also uses the <att>full</att> attribute to
          distinguish between the full name of the part and the initials of the party. Parties
          are also created and dissolved, and can also change their name.  The former is
          indicated by the <gi>event</gi> element, which, in the example above, we have typed
          as "existence" and where the dates of its existence are given in the <att>from</att>
          and <att>to</att> attributes. The same attributes on the <gi>orgName</gi> elements
          indicate the temporal duration of the parties names.<note>Note that there can exist a
          date where both names are valid names of the party - it is up to the processing
          software to make sense of this situation.</note></p>
        </div>

        <div xml:id="sec-relation">
          <head>Relationships between people and parties</head>
          
          <p>It is also possible to encode relations between people and parties, e.g. kinship between
          MPs, or that one party is the successor of another one. For this purpose, TEI defines the
          <gi>listRelation</gi> element explained in detail in the Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html#NDPERSREL">Personal
          Relationships</ref> of the TEI Guidelines. This element can be contained by the
          <gi>listPerson</gi> or <gi>listOrg</gi> elements and, in turn, contains the
          <gi>relation</gi> elements, each of which defines one relation. The example below shows a
          relation between people.

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-relatpers">
            <relation name="parent" passive="#sbi243926" active="#sbi243926-0 #sbi243926-1"/>
          </egXML>

          The relation defines the relationship "parent" between the <att>active</att> persons of
          this relationship (i.e. those defined in the <gi>person</gi> element with the
          <att>xml:id</att> values of <val>sbi243926-0</val> and <val>sbi243926-1</val>) and the
          <att>passive</att> person of this relationship (i.e. the <gi>person</gi> element with the
          <att>xml:id</att> value of <val>sbi243926</val>).</p>

          <p>Relationships can also be mutual, e.g. in the case of spouses, as illustrated below
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-relatmutual">
            <relation name="spouse" mutual="#sbi243926 #sbi243929"/>
          </egXML>
          </p>

          <p>Relationship can also exist between parties (i.e. organisations), for example the
          fact that one party is a successor of another. This can be expressed as in the
          example below.

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-succparty">
            <relation name="successor" passive="#pp.SDZ" active="#pp.DS"/>
          </egXML>

          Another example is of a coalition of parties, where the coalition is also encoded
          as an organisation, while the <gi>relation</gi> gives the membership of the
          individual parties in the coalition.
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-relatorg">
            <listOrg>
              <org xml:id="cl.DEMOS" role="coalition">

              </org>
              <listRelation>
                <relation type="members"
                          pasive="#cl.DEMOS"
                          active="#pp.SDZ #pp.SDSS #pp.SKD #pp.SKZ #pp.SOS #pp.ZS"/>
              </listRelation>

          <p>In the transcriptions the main distinction to be made is between the
          transcriptions of the utterances of the speakers against the commentary inserted by
          the transcriber, such as the titles of the divisions, results of voting, comments on
          what is happening in the chamber etc. The former should be encoded using the
          utterance element, <gi>u</gi>, while latter are encoded using a variety of elements,
          such as <gi>head</gi> or <gi>note</gi>, and possibly others, as further discussed
          below. Below we give an example of a rather straightforward start of a division:

          The example starts with the division heading, saying that this is the National Assembly
          of the Republic of Slovenia, with the second heading specifying that this is the
          continuation of the 39th session. Next come three notes, first one specifying who
          chaired the session, the second when the session started and the third the name of the
          first speaker. It should be noted that these are not formal specifications, rather,
          they are simply parts of the transcript that have been wrapped in certain elements.</p>
          
          <p>After these preliminary notes comes the transcript of the speech proper, which, as
          mentioned, is encoded using the <gi>u</gi> element. Its main attribute is
          <att>who</att>, giving the pointer to the <gi>person</gi> element containing the
          metadata of the speaker. The <gi>u</gi> element can also have the <att>ana</att>
          attribute giving one or more pointers to a typology of types of speakers. In our case,
          it would point to a category that specifies that the speaker is the chair of the
          session.</p>
          
          <p>The utterances can (but are not required to) be segmented using the generic
          TEI element for segments, <gi>seg</gi>, encoding the paragraphs of the source
          transcription.<note>The reason why the TEI element for paragraphs (<gi>p</gi>) is not
          used is that utterances, being essentially (transcriptions of) spoken text, do not
          allow for internal paragraphs, a concept pertinent to written text.</note></p>
        </div>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-incidents">
          <head>Incidents</head>
          <p>In general, transcriber comments are encoded using <gi>note</gi> but some such
          comments can be encoded using more precise TEI elements.<note>Whether these specific
          elements will be used or simply encoded using notes, and, indeed, whether such notes
          are preserved in the Parla-CLARIN encoding at all, will depend on the needs and
          resources of each particular project.</note> In particular, the TEI module for
          Transcription of Speech (<q><ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TS.html#TSBA">Elements
          unique to spoken texts</ref></q>) defines the following elements that can correspond
          to various types of transcriber's comments:
          <list>
            <item><gi>vocal</gi> marks any vocalized but not necessarily lexical phenomenon,
            e.g. laughter, sounds of (dis)agreement from the benches etc.</item>
            <item><gi>kinesic</gi> marks any communicative phenomenon, not necessarily
            vocalized, for example clapping, a gesture or frown, etc.</item>
            <item><gi>incident</gi> marks any phenomenon or occurrence, not necessarily
            vocalized or communicative, for example incidental noises or other events
            affecting communication.</item>
          </list>
          
          The artificial example below illustrates the use of these three elements:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-incidents">
            <u xml:lang="sl" who="#SDZ5.AhačičMonika">Spoštovani kolegice poslanke!</u>
            <vocal who="#opposition"><desc xml:lang="en">shouting</desc></vocal>
            <kinesic who="#SDZ5.AhačičMonika"><desc xml:lang="en">banging the gavel</desc></kinesic>
            <incident><desc xml:lang="en">army storms the parliament</desc></incident>
            <kinesic who="#governmet"><desc xml:lang="en">clapping</desc></kinesic>
          </egXML>
	  
          It should be noted that the four <q>incident</q> elements could have been also encoded
          within the <gi>u</gi> element, however, it is recommended to have them placed outside,
          because, ideally, the utterance elements should contain pure text only, as this
          significantly simplifies their linguistic processing. However, if the same speech continued
          after these elements, then they would need to be encoded inside the utterance.</p>
        </div>

        <div xml:id="sec-gaps">
          <head>Gaps</head>
	  <p>The transcribers often note that a part of the speech was not transcribed due to
	  the fact that the recording could not be understood, sometimes also noting the
	  reason, e.g. that the the microphone was not turned on, that there was noise in the
	  chamber or the speaker was speaking too quietly etc. These notes can be encoded as
	  the <gi>gap</gi> element, which is then also marked by the <att>reason</att> <val>inaudible</val>.
	  The original tracriber note can be left in the <gi>desc</gi> element, as illustrated below.
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-gap">
	    ... I would further state that
	    <gap reason="inaudible">

	    </gap>
	    and furthermore ....

        <div xml:id="sec-interruptions">
          <head>Interrupted utterances</head>
          <p>A special case occurs when a transcription note states that somebody interrupted
          the speaker and gives the transcript of the interruption, with the main speaker
          then continuing with their speech, as in this snippet of a made-up transcript:
          
          <eg>Boris Johnson: I propose a no-deal Brexit. /Jeremy Corbyn: Traitor!/ Because 
          England does not want any dealings with the European Union.</eg>
          
          While the interruption might be encoded as a <gi>note</gi>, it is more precisely
          encoded as a separate utterance, which brings with it the problem that nested
          utterances are not allowed, so the main utterance needs to be split into two (or
          more) pieces. The example below illustrates how this is encoded:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-splitu">
            <u who="#BorisJohnson" xml:id="GB001.8.3" next="#GB001.8.5">I propose a no-deal Brexit.</u>
            <u who="#JeremyCorbyn" xml:id="GB001.8.4">Traitor!</u>
            <u who="#BorisJohnson" xml:id="GB001.8.5" prev="#GB001.8.3">Because England does not want any dealings with the European Union.</u>
          </egXML>
          
          As can be seen, the split is indicated by the use of the <att>next</att> attribute on
          the first part of the split utterance, and, if so desired, by the <att>prev</att>
          attribute of the next part of the split utterance. The values of the attributes are
          pointers to the next of previous part of the split utterance.<note>Note that, in
          general, the utterance can also be split in the middle of a sentence, which brings
          with it problems for automatic linguistic processing, as, ideally, the parts should
          be first joined, and only then processed.</note></p>

        <div xml:id="sec-qa">
          <head>Addressees, questions and answers</head>
	  <p>Sometimes particular speeches are in fact questions (or statements) addressed to a
	  person, or answers to particular questions, again, directed at the person that posed the
	  question, and it might be advantageous to encode this fact. The encoding of a question and
	  answer, and to whom it is directed is illustrated below.
	  
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-qa">
            <u xml:id="q_1" who="#kappa" toWhom="#eta" ana="#question">

            </u>
          </egXML>
	  
	  The preson at whom a speech is directed is encoded in the <att>toWhom</att> attribute on
	  the <gi>u</gi> element, which is, same as <att>who</att>, a reference which must point to a
	  defined person. For the fact that the first speech is an question, and the second an
	  answer, we here presuppose a taxononmy in the <gi>teiHeader</gi> of the corpus, which
	  defines the types of utterances the we wish to distinguish, and the <val>question</val> and
	  <val>answer</val> are IDs of the appropriate categories.

        <div xml:id="sec-voting">
          <head>Voting results</head>
          <p>One further aspects of the transcripts, which can be of particular interest for
          some researchers, needs to be mentioned, namely voting results. Voting results are
          typically mentioned in the transcripts as a note, and we follow Akoma Ntoso in its
          treatment. Assuming a <gi>taxonomy</gi> in the TEI header that defines "ayes" and
          "noes", the note can be marked up using the <gi>measure</gi> element, as the
          following example shows:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-voting1">
            <note type="summary">(Question carried by
            <measure xml:id="quantity_1" corresp="#ayes" quantity="72">72</measure> to
            <measure xml:id="quantity_2" corresp="#noes" quantity="56">56</measure>
            votes)</note>
          </egXML>
          </p>

          <p>In addition to marking up the voting results in-line, they can also be more
          formally encoding at the start of the <gi>body</gi>, using the <gi>listEvent</gi>
          element to contain the list of individual votes in the <gi>event</gi> elements. Below
          we give a more complicated example, where the voting was followed by a recount, and
          this fact is encoded in the <gi>relation</gi> element, of course, again assuming the
          appropriate taxonomies in the teiHeader:

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-voting2">

        <head>Linguistic annotation</head>
        <p>This section introduces basic types of linguistic annotation that can be added
        to PPCs; the examples should be sufficient for users to be able to add further types
        of linguistic annotation to PPC corpora.</p>
        <p>It is recommended that linguistically annotated PPCs are stored in two versions,
        one with the linguistic annotations, and the other without them. The reason for this
        is that many users prefer to use the plain-text version, e.g. as they want to perform
        their own linguistic annotation, or this kind of annotation is simply not relevant for
        their research questions.</p>
        
        <p>The TEI Guidelines discuss basic linguistic annotation in their Chapter on <ref
        target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AI.html">Simple Analytic
        Mechanisms</ref> and we follow one particular option given there. In particular, it is
        recommended that (where possible) the annotation is in-line (as opposed to stand-off),
        i.e. that the linguistic annotation is given in the main document, and therefore mixed
        with the other annotations, rather than in a separate document with pointers into the
        base text.</p>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-anawords">
          <head>Basic word-level annotation</head>
          
          <p>Basic linguistic annotation comprises sentence segmentation, tokenisation,
          part-of-speech tagging and lemmatisation. The Parla-CLARIN recommendations
          specialise the recommendations given in the Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AI.html#AILALW">Lightweight
          Linguistic Annotation</ref> of the TEI Guidelines. The following example shows the
          basic principles of the annotation:

            </s>
          </egXML>
          
          Sentences are marked up using the <gi>s</gi> element, words with the <gi>w</gi>
          element and punctuation symbols with the <gi>pc</gi> element. To retain the
          linguistically significant whitespace, the <att>join</att> element is used, with the
          possible values being <val>no</val> (assumed to be the default), <val>right</val>
          (no whitespace to the right of the token) and <val>left</val> (no whitespace to the
          left of the token) and <val>both</val> (no whitespace to either side of the
          token). While, in the preceding example, it would be more intuitive to have the
          value <val>left</val> marked on the full-stop, we recommend that only the value
          <val>right</val> is used on the preceding token, as this simplifies processing.</p>
          
          <p>The base form of a word is given in the <att>lemma</att> attribute,<note>Note
          that punctuation characters, <gi>pc</gi>, do not have a <att>lemma</att> attribute,
          as they cannot sensibly be said to have lemmas.</note> while the situation with the
          part-of-speech tags is somewhat more complicated. For analytic tagsets, where a
          "part-of-speech tag" is actually a set of attribute-values, as in the example above,
          the <att>msd</att> attribute should be used. For synthetic tagsets, such as the <ref
          target="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html">Penn
          Treebank tagset</ref>, which have atomic tags that cannot always be decomposed into
          attribute-value pairs (e.g. "TO" for the word "to"), a better alternative is to use
          of the <att>pos</att> attribute.</p>

	  <p>There is also a third option, for tags that are look like strings, however, they
	  are meant as a shorthand for a feature-structure representation, as is the case with
	  the <ref target="http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V6/msd/html/">MULTEXT-East tagset</ref>. For
	  these, it is best to use the generic <att>ana</att> attribute, whose value is a
	  pointer, as shown in the following example:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-msd">
            <s>
              <w ana="#Pd-nsg" lemma="ta">Tega</w>
              <w ana="#Px------y" lemma="se">se</w>
              <w ana="#Q" lemma="sploh">sploh</w>
              <w ana="#Va-r1s-y" lemma="biti">nisem</w>
              <w ana="#Vmep-sm" lemma="zavesti" join="right">zavedel</w>
              <pc ana="#Z">.</pc>
            </s>
          </egXML>
          
          Here, the tags are pointers to identifiers, where the elements bearing these
          identifiers define the appropriate feature-structures, i.e. pairs of
          attribute-values, as in the example below:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-fs">
            <fs xml:id="Pd-nsg" xml:lang="en">
              <f name="CATEGORY"><symbol value="Pronoun"/></f>
              <f name="Type"><symbol value="demonstrative"/></f>
              <f name="Gender"><symbol value="neuter"/></f>
              <f name="Number"><symbol value="singular"/></f>
              <f name="Case"><symbol value="genitive"/></f>
            </fs>
          </egXML>
          </p>

	  <p>Such feature structures are grouped together in the feature-value library
	  (<gi>fvLib</gi>) element, which can be contained in its own <gi>TEI</gi> element of
	  the corpus. As <att>ana</att> is a pointer, it can also contain complete URLs
	  (e.g. <code>http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V6/msd/tables/msd-fslib2-sl.xml#Pd-nsg</code>) which
	  enables the feature-structure definitions to be stored externaly to the
	  corpus. However, prefixing such PoS tags for each token by the complete URL would
	  lead to very large files. This is why the TEI offers a mechanism to shorten 
	  references to URLs. This mechanism is explained in the Section <ref
	  target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SA.html#SAPU">Using
	  Abbreviated Pointers</ref> of the TEI Guidelines, and we give below and example:
	  
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-prefix">
            <s>
              <w ana="mte:Pd-nsg" lemma="ta">Tega</w>
              <w ana="mte:Px------y" lemma="se">se</w>
              <w ana="mte:Q" lemma="sploh">sploh</w>
              <w ana="mte:Va-r1s-y" lemma="biti">nisem</w>

            </s>
          </egXML>
	  
	  As can be seen, the only difference to the preceding example is that the values (IDs) of
	  the tags are preceded by <code>mte:</code> rather than <code>#</code>. This prefix should
	  be then expanded by the processing software to whatever the <gi>prefixDef</gi> element,
	  defined in the TEI header, specifies, as shown in the example below:
	  
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-prefixDef">
            <prefixDef ident="mte"

          <head>Normalised words</head>
          
          <p>In certain contexts a word (or, in general, a token) in the transcription needs to
          be normalised, in particular for very old PPCs that contain archaic forms and where
          we wish to include their orthographically modernised forms. For this the
          <att>norm</att> attribute on word or punctuation tokens should be used, as explained
          at the end of the Section
	  <ref target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AI.html#AILALW">Lightweight
          Linguistic Annotation</ref> of the TEI Guidelines.</p>

	  <p>More challenging is the case where one original word token must be represented as
	  several normalised words. Again, this can happen in historical corpora, but also in
	  cases where a surface word should be decomposed into several syntactic words, as is
	  e.g. allowed in the <ref
	  target="https://universaldependencies.org/format.html#words-tokens-and-empty-nodes">Universal
	  Dependencies schema</ref>. For this we recommend using embedded empty words with
	  associated <att>norm</att> attributes, and possibly other attributes with linguistic
	  annotation. For example, Czech has the word <q>abyste</q> which is decomposed into
	  two syntactic words, <q>aby</q> and <q>byste</q>. This should be encoded as in the
	  following example:

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-1-2">
	    <w>abyste<w norm="aby" lemma="aby"/><w norm="byste" lemma="být"/></w>
          </egXML>
	  </p>
	  
          <p>For historical corpora there are also cases where two (or more) original words
          correspond to one modernised word. For such cases, it is the outer word that carries
          the <att>norm</att> and other linguistic attributes, while the inner words are the
          original ones. For example, Slovene used to form the superlative form of adjectives
          with the word <q>naj</q> written separately (and often as <q>nar</q>), while in
          contemporary Slovene the <q>naj</q> is a prefix of the adjective. This case should be
          encoded as follows:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-2-1">
	    <w norm="najlepši" lemma="lep"><w>nar</w> <w>lepši</w></w>

          <head>Segmental annotation</head>
          
          <p>A common annotation type, used e.g. for marking named entities or terms, is
          segmental annotation, where a stretch of text or tokens is simply enclosed in XML
          tags, as the following example illustrates:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-names">
            <s>

          </egXML>
          
          TEI offers a number of elements that can be used for such annotations,
          e.g.:

          In the example, each token, as well as the sentence element are given an ID, and the
          first link group specifies the Universal Dependencies syntactic analysis of the
          sentence, while the second one give its semantic role labels.  They are distinguished
          by their <att>type</att> attribute<note>We do not specify the values of
          <att>type</att> of the link gropu as the range of possibilities is too great and not
          known in advance.</note>, while the <att>targFunc</att> attribute explains the
          functions of the references given in the <att>target</att> attributes of the contained
          <gi>link</gi> elements.</p>
          
          <p>The contained links then give the references to the head and argument tokens of
          the relation, while the <att>ana</att> attribute specifies what kind of a relation
          this is. It should be noted that the value of the analysis attribute is a pointer,
          and, in the example, we use the TEI prefix mechanism, which is then expanded via the
          <gi>prefixDef</gi> element in the TEI header to resolve into a URI pointer (as
          explained in Section on <ref target="#sec-idents">Identifiers and referencing</ref>),
          most likely to pointing to <gi>taxonomy</gi> categories that give the definitions of
          the relations. A further point to notice is that the sentence serves as the Root
          element of the sentence, i.e. the fifth link of the UD analysis ties together the
          sentence with the top-most token of the sentence.</p>

        <p>Parliamentary corpora can also have data from other modalities associated with the
        transcripts, in particular audio or video recordings, and the facsimile of the original
        transcripts, particularly relevant for older parliamentary proceedings. This section
        explains how to encode such data in the TEI encoded documents, where it is assumed that
        the actual speech, video and images are stored in separate files, and the TEI document
        makes reference to them.</p>

          <p>The transcription can refer to and align with external audio and video data using
          the <gi>timeline</gi> element, explained in the Section on <ref

          resource management -- Transcription of spoken language</ref>. While the ISO standard
          is better elaborated, it also changes and adds element definitions, so we are using
          the standard TEI variant of speech encoding as far as the schema is concerned, while
          taking into account, as much as possible, specific encoding choices as proposed by
          the ISO standard.</p>
          
          <p>First, TEI offers the <gi>recordingStmt</gi> element (a part of <gi>fileDesc</gi>
          of the TEI header) which contains the information about the recording(s) of the
          transcription. This information can be unstructured (i.e. a series of <gi>ab</gi>
          elements) or structured (contained in the <gi>recording</gi> element); Parla-CLARIN
          recommends the structured version. As shown in the example below, the element
          contains information of the type of recording (audio / video), its duration<note>The
          <att>dur</att> values should follow the <ref
          target="https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xmlschema-2-20041028/#duration">W3C

          (<gi>respStmt</gi>) of the person or agency that made the recording, the date when
          the recording file was made and the equipment used:

          </p>
          
          <p>The mapping of time intervals of the recording to IDs in the TEI document is
          encoded in the <gi>timeline</gi> element, in particular in the contained
          <gi>when</gi> elements. As explained below, these IDs are then used to link elements
          in the transcription to the timeline, therefore each <gi>when</gi> element must have
          the <att>xml:id</att> attribute. The <gi>when</gi> elements must also be in the same
          order as the time-points they encode.</p>
          
          <p>As the example below shows, the timeline gives the unit in which the intervals are
          specified (typically second, <code>s</code>) and the time origin of the timeline,
          here referring to the first <gi>when</gi> element, at the very start of the
          recording, so specified with the absolute time.  Further <gi>when</gi> elements give
          the interval between this origin point and their end:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-timeline">
            <timeline unit="s" origin="#T0">
              <when xml:id="T0" absolute="00:00:00.0"/>
              <when xml:id="T1" interval="1.13" since="#T0"/>
              <when xml:id="T2" interval="3.84" since="#T0"/>
              <when xml:id="T3" interval="5.33" since="#T0"/>
              <when xml:id="T4" interval="9.35" since="#T0"/>
              <when xml:id="T5" interval="12.62" since="#T0"/>
            </timeline>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          
          <p>The IDs of the timeline synchronisation are then used by elements in the
          transcription (e.g. <gi>u</gi> or <gi>seg</gi>) via their <att>start</att> and
          <att>end</att> attributes. In the examples below we see three cases of such linking:
          the first one gives a straightforward temporal structure; the second one uses the
          empty <gi>anchor</gi> element to give additional temporal structure for cases where
          the synchronised parts of the utterance are not further marked-up; and the third and
          fourth demonstrate the case where two utterances are partially overlapping:<note>Note
          that in such cases we would also use the <att>prev</att> and <att>next</att>
          attributes, as shown in the <ref target="#exa-splitu">Example on split
          utterances</ref>.</note>:

          <p>Especially for older parliamentary proceedings, where the exact appearance of the
          original proceedings is of interest, it can be advantageous to also enable viewing
          the facsimile together with the transcription. How to achieve this in general is
          explained in the <ref

          <p>The simplest but also the most limiting way to achieve this is to have per-page
          facsimile files and use the page break i.e. <gi>pb</gi> element to mark page
          boundaries in the transcript and then directly specify the image file of the page
          with the <att>facs</att> attribute, as illustrated in the example below:

              <!-- text contained on page 2 encoded here -->
            </body>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          
          <p>By convention, this encoding indicates that the image indicated by the <att>facs</att>
          attribute represents the whole of the text following the <gi>pb</gi> element, up
          to the next <gi>pb</gi> element.</p>
          
          <p>A more complicated solution, where it is possible to have several images per page
          (e.g. in different resolutions) or to specify areas of a page is enabled by the
          <gi>facsimile</gi> element, which should appear immediately before the <gi>text</gi>
          element of a TEI document. The example below refers to the first and third pages
          directly with the <gi>graphic</gi> element, whereas the second page is encoded as a
          <gi>surface</gi> which then contains the page image in two resolutions:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-facsimile">
            <facsimile>
              <graphic xml:id="page1" url="PNG/page1.png"/>
              <surface xml:id="page2">
                <graphic type="600dpi" url="PNG/page2-highRes.png"/>
                <graphic type="300dpi" url="PNG/page2-lowRes.png"/>
              </surface>
              <graphic xml:id="page3" url="PNG/page3.png"/>
            </facsimile>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          
          <p>More complicated cases, such as delimiting portions of a page are also supported
          by the TEI Guidelines, and for these the reader is referred directly to the Section
          on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html#PHFAX">Digital

        <p>A TEI encoded document is, in general, not meant to be used directly by software
        programs, rather it serves as an interchange and storage format.  Furthermore, most TEI
        documents are not "born TEI", but rather converted into TEI from some source format.
        In this section we discuss some up- and down-conversion scripts that have already been
        developed for transforming source formats into Parla-CLARIN and from Parla-CLARIN into
        formats immediately usable by software and are available in the Git repository of
        Parla-CLARIN.</p>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-convakn">
          <head>Conversion from Akoma Ntoso</head>
          <p>As mentioned in the Section on <ref target="#sec-akoma">Introducing Akoma
          Ntoso</ref>, this standard is used to encode parliamentary proceedings of several
          countries, and this section introduces the developed conversion of AKN documents to
          Parla-CLARIN. The example documents and conversion script can be found in the
          <code>Examples/AkomaNtoso</code> folder of the Parla-CLARIN Git repository. For a
          detailed treatment of the conversion, the XSLT script <code>akn2tei.xsl</code> should
          be consulted, while we here mention only some of the more aspects of the
          conversion.</p>

          <p>First, and on a minor point, the conversion to TEI attempts to preserve the IDs of
          the source AKN document, however, Akoma Ntoso distinguishes three ID-bearing
          attributes, namely <att>eId</att> (expression identifier), <att>wId</att> (work
          identifier) and <att>GUID</att> (globally unique identifier). The first is simply
          mapped to the <att>xml:id</att> attribute of the TEI document, while the latter two
          are given in the <gi>publicationStmt</gi> of the TEI header and in the 
          <gi>idno</gi> element, as the following example illustrates:

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-akn-id">
            <idno type="wId" corresp="#section_2_1">section_2_2</idno>
            <idno type="GUID" corresp="#section_2_2">X13242</idno>
          </egXML>
          </p>

          <div xml:id="sec-convakn-frbr">
            <head>FRBR data</head>
            <p>Akoma Ntoso makes use of <ref
            target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_Requirements_for_Bibliographic_Records">FRBR</ref>,
            in particular to distinguish a <q>work</q> from its <q>expression</q>, and this one
            from its <q>manifestation</q>. This information is in AKN encoded in the
            <gi>identification</gi> element, which appears inside the <gi>meta</gi> element, as
            shown in the example below:

            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-frbr-akn">
              <identification source="#palmirani">

                </FRBRManifestation>
              </identification>
            </egXML>
            
            Some of these elements are mapped to specific TEI elements or attributes, e.g. the
            language of the text specified in the <gi>FRBRExpression</gi> maps to the
            <att>xml:lang</att> of the <gi>TEI</gi> element, but this does not hold for all the
            FRBR information, which we also wanted to retain in the TEI document.</p>
            
            <p>To convert all FRBR information to TEI, we used the recommendations of <ref
            target="https://tei-c.org/extra/teiinlibraries/">Best Practices for TEI in
            Libraries</ref>, in particular as given the Section on <ref
            target="https://tei-c.org/extra/teiinlibraries/4.0.0/bptl-driver.html#frbr">The TEI
            Header and FRBR</ref>,<note>Encoding FRBR in TEI is (at greater length than in the
            official documentation) also discussed in <ref
            target="https://github.com/kshawkin/Best-Practices-for-TEI-in-Libraries/issues/64">Issue
            #64</ref> of Best-Practices-for-TEI-in-Libraries GitHub repository.</note> where
            it is recommended that FRBR information is encoded in the <gi>sourceDesc</gi>
            element of the TEI header as a <gi>listRelation</gi>. As opposed to the original
            AKN <gi>identification</gi> the <gi>listRelation</gi> contains a simple list of
            <gi>relation</gi> elements, so these must also specify the relation between the
            particular piece of data and the fact that it belongs to the FRBR <q>work</q>,
            <q>expression</q>, or <q>manifestation</q>. These and other formalised relations
            are taken from the formal vocabularies of <ref
            target="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</ref> (for RDF and OWL) and (via <ref
            target="http://purl.org/">purl.org</ref>) of <ref
            target="https://www.dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</ref> and <ref
            target="http://vocab.org/">vocab.org</ref>.

              attribute, which does not have a controlled vocabulary, its value is retained in
              the <att>name</att> attribute of the TEI <gi>relation</gi>.</item>

              <item>The conversion also specifies the formal equivalence (OWL
              <code>sameAs</code>) of the official FRBR definition of <q>work</q>,
              <q>expression</q>, and <q>manifestation</q> (so, <ref
              target="http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/">http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/</ref>) with the
              AKN recommended ontology of these terms, namely <ref
              target="https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/allot">https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/allot/</ref>.</item>

          <div xml:id="sec-convakn-qa">
            <head>Converting addressee, role, questions and answers</head>
            <p>Akoma Ntoso can directly specify not only the speaker of an utterance (as the
            value of the <att>by</att> attribute) but also the role of the speaker for a
            particular utterance (<att>as</att> attribute) and to whom the speech is addressed
            to (<att>to</att> attribute), as exemplified below:
            
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-akn-to">
              <speech by="#khalwale" to="#speaker" as="#pm">

                ...
              </speech>
            </egXML>

	    TEI has the attribute <att>toWhom</att>, which directly corresponds to the <att>to</att>
	    attribute. TEI, however, does not have an attribute that would correspond to the AKN
	    <att>as</att>, so this is encoded as the value of the general <att>ana</att> attribute,
	    which should point to the appropriate <gi>category</gi> of the pertinent taxonomy for
	    defining the roles of the speakers. The Parla-CLARIN encoding is thus:

            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-akn-totei">
              <u who="#khalwale" ana="#pm" toWhom="#speaker">
                <seg>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to give notice of the following Motion:-</seg>

            </egXML>
            </p>
            
            <p>A similar problem, and its solution, concerns the distinction made in Akoma
            Ntoso between questions and answers, each of which has in AKN a dedicated element,
            as shown in the following example:
            
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-akn-qa">

            In the conversion to TEI we note that someting is a question or answer (or, in fact, any
            other type of utterance) by assuming a taxonomy specifying the categories corresponding
            to the types of speeches that we wish to distinguish, and the <val>question</val> and
            <val>answer</val> are IDs of the appropriate categories. We can then refer to these
            categories in the <att>ana</att> attribute of the utterance. Furthermore, and in case we
            wish to direclty link the question and answer, we can use for this the <gi>relation</gi>
            element using its <att>name</att> with the value <code>questionAnswer</code>. Such
            <gi>listRelation</gi> can be placed in an arbitrary portion of the document, as it
            contains links to IDs, but is, by convention, best placed inside the answer. We exemplify
            the Parla-CLARIN encoding of a question and answer below:

          <head>Conversion to RDF</head>
          <p>As explained in the Section on <ref target="#sec-rdf">Introducing
          RDF</ref>, this data model would be a useful <q>down-conversion</q> of
          Parla-CLARIN corpora.</p>
          
          <p>On the tei-l mailing list there have already been discussions on how to
          link TEI with RDF, summarised and with further links in <ref
          target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1860">Issue #1860</ref> of the
          <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/">TEI GitHub project</ref>.
          The best way seems to be to either directly turn TEI markup into RDF triples,
          or, where this is not possible, to use the RDFa attribute on TEI elements.</p>

          <p>An implementation might be best approached from the opposite direction,
          i.e. developing an <q>up-conversion</q> to TEI of an existing RDF-encoded
          CPP.</p>
