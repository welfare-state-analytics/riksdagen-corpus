            During my five years as Speaker of the Riksdag, we have arranged
            solemn ceremonies in this Chamber celebrating the fiftieth anniversary
            of the United
          </note>
          <note>
            Nations, of the United Nations' Declaration on Human Rights and
            - only a few weeks ago - the Council of Europe.
          </note>
          <note>
            The purpose of these manifestations has been to demonstrate the
            strong and unwavering support of the
          </note>
          <note>
            Riksdag and the Swedish people for the struggle against war and
            violence for human rights and human dignity.
          </note>
          <note>
            One of the very pillars of Swedish foreign policy is the belief
            in and support to the United Nations. For this reason the Secretary-
            General of the United Nations is the only person outside the Riksdag
            and the

            We are right now living in a critical period of time, when we
            are forced to observe serious breaches of the peace, which we
            all desire, and disrespect for human rights, human dignity and
            even human lives.

            In this complicated and difficult situation it is growing more

            It is with great admiration that we have followed your personal
            contributions to the important work of the United Nations - both
            in terms of the reform process that you initiated and of the courageous
            political initiatives you have undertaken to solve complex and
            dangerous situations.

          <note>
            It is always a great honour to be invited to address the Parliament
            of a Member State. Today that honour is combined, for me, with
            a kind of homecoming -
          </note>
          <note>
            not just because I am married to a Swede, but because the United
            Nations has a close family relationship with the whole nation
            of Sweden.

          <note>
            This country is not only an island of stability in an unstable
            world, it is also a bastion of solidarity.
          </note>
          <note>
            Throughout the history of the United Nations, you have shown
            exemplary commitment to its goals and activities: to peacekeeping
            and peacemaking, to development and international law, to human
            security and human rights. By doing so, you have helped people
            far beyond your borders feel that the world is a safer place.
          </note>
          <note>
            Today, your solidarity is more important than ever. Safety and
            stability are in short supply not only on other continents, but
            even in parts of Europe, as you, Madam Speaker, referred to earlier.
          </note>
          <note>
            In this day and age, people in different parts of the world are
            directly affected by each other's actions more than ever before
            in human history.

            An automobile may be assembled in one continent from parts manufactured
            in two or more others. Billions of dollars are moved across the
            world in seconds by pressing a few keys on a computer terminal.

            A sporting event or a rock concert can be watched in real time
            by thousands of people miles away. So also can scenes of war and
            terrible suffering.
          </note>
          <note>
            Like almost everything else in life, this phenomenon has good
            and bad aspects. It brings us many opportunities to learn from
            each other and to benefit from a wider range of choices.
          </note>
          <note>
            But it can also seem threatening. Workers may find their jobs
            made suddenly obsolete by imported technology or foreign competition.
            Parents find their children attracted by products and role models
            from foreign cultures or alien cultures, as some call it.
          </note>
          <note>
            Sometimes the world even seems to be losing its spice and variety.
            Instead of widening our choices, globalization can seem to be
            forcing us all into the same shallow, consumerist culture - giving
            us all the same appetites but leaving us more unequal than ever
            in our ability to satisfy them.
          </note>
          <note>
            That feeling accounts for much of the fear and anger we see in
            today's world. In many places, very destructive forces have been
            unleashed. We like to call them inhuman, but in reality they are
            all too human: They are one of the ways our human nature reacts
            when we feel ourselves threatened.
          </note>
          <note>
            These are global challenges, which need global solutions, hammered
            out multilaterally, so that all states accept them as legitimate,
            and feel committed to implementing them.
          </note>
          <note>
            There has to be a forum where these issues can be debated openly
            - where all participants can feel they have a say. You will not
            be surprised to hear me say that that forum is the United Nations.
          </note>
          <note>
            Of course it is not easy. There are times when the process of
            reaching agreement in the United Nations seems too slow and cumbersome
            as to make swift, decisive action impossible. And then States
            feel that they are justified in taking the law into their own
            hands - as the members of Nato did when they took unilateral action,
            rather than watch the horrors continue in Kosovo unchecked.
          </note>
          <note>
            I fully understood that feeling. In this age when the power of
            states to control their economy or their environment is limited
            by global forces, surely we cannot allow their one unchallenged
            power to be that of persecuting their own citizens?
          </note>
          <note>
            On the day the action began, I expressed my own frustration at
            the rejection of a political settlement by the Yugoslav authorities,
            and said that "there are times when the use of force may be legitimate
            in the pursuit of peace."
          </note>
          <note>
            But I also reminded the world, with equal emphasis, that under
            the Charter of the United Nations it is the Security Council which
            has primary responsibility for maintaining international peace
            and security.
          </note>
          <note>
            As the conflict has developed, there are today two principles
            on which all parties seem to agree. One is that the Kosovar Albanians
            must be enabled to return to their homes in safety, with their
            security and political and human rights internationally guaranteed
            and protected. The other is that ultimately such issues of war
            and peace must be settled within the framework of the United Nations.
          </note>
          <note>
            The sooner we can reach a political solution giving effect to
            both those principles the better it will be for everyone, and
            especially for the suffering people of Yugoslavia, whatever their
            ethnic affiliation.
          </note>
          <note>
            Ever since 1945, the United Nations Charter has provided the
            recognized and indispensable framework of international co-operation.
            If anything, that has been even more true since the end of the
            Cold
          </note>
          <note>
            War, which removed the biggest obstacle to such cooperation.
          </note>
          <note>
            Increasingly, not only Governments but people the world over
            have looked to the United Nations, as the forum in which agreements
            can be reached to safeguard their interests.

            You as parliamentarians know this. You are elected by the people,

            You know well how much people care about the barbarity of anti-personnel
            landmines. It was pressure from your constituents, alongside many
            thousands of others, that pushed governments to sign the Ottawa
          </note>
          <u>
            <seg>
              Convention.
            </seg>
          </u>
          <note>
            It is partly thanks to you, and other parliaments around the
            world, that the Convention is now in force, having been ratified
            by more than the 60 requisite countries. I hope that other parliaments
            will soon follow your example, particularly those of several major
            landmine producing and exporting countries which are not yet parties
            to the Convention.
          </note>
          <note>
            To give one more example, you know well how strongly Swedish
            people feel - as do those in many other countries - about the
            crimes against humanity whose authors too often get away scot-free,
            as though the murder of a thousand people were somehow less culpable
            than that of one. It was thanks to popular pressure from all over
            the world that governments agreed in Rome last summer on the Statute
            of the
          </note>
          <note>
            International Criminal Court. I urge you and your fellow parliamentarians
            around the world to speed up the process of ratification of the
            Rome Statute. We must not loose the momentum in bringing this
            extraordinary achievement into fruition at the earliest possible
            date.
          </note>
          <note>
            I hope that the court will be ratified and that we can begin
            to function by december 2000. It will be a wonderful gift to give
            to future generations, particulary as we enter a new millennium.
          </note>
          <note>
            Your constituents understand, I believe, how important it is
            for a global society to have shared norms and values, codified
            in a framework of international law - just as a national community
            can only survive so long as its members agree on certain core
            values which are reflected in domestic law. Without shared values,
            without agreed norms it is very difficult to hold a community
            together. This in my judgement applies to the international level
            and what we call the international community.
          </note>
          <note>
            What they may not realize is how much the United Nations does,
            in quiet, unreported ways, to provide the world community with
            a framework of codified international law.

            Even in this learned assembly, I suspect there are some members
            who have not heard of UNCITRAL -

          <note>
            the United Nations Commission on International
          </note>
          <note>
            Trade Law. Yet this body plays an essential role in facilitating
            international trade and reducing transaction costs, through its
            work of standardizing the laws which govern commercial transactions.
            It is one of many parts of the United Nations system that establish,
            maintain and gradually extend the "soft infrastructure", making
            possible the international exchange of goods, money and information.
          </note>
          <note>
            When people say the United Nations is "no longer relevant", I
            believe they overlook, or underrate, the importance of such contributions
            to global governance.

          </note>
          <note>
            Nations in upholding human rights and humanitarian law. Today
            I just want to remind you that these form part of a wider principle:
            It is respect for the rule of law which distinguishes a civilized,
            secure society from an anarchic one.
          </note>
          <note>
            That is true for countries, and in the end it must be true for
            the emerging international order as well. If we do not have established
            rules and procedures, or if we fail to abide by them, we are condemned
            to live by the law of the jungle, in which the strong devour the
            weak. It was to save humanity from that fate that the United Nations
            was set up in the first place.

            In this vital task of global governance, you parliamentarians
            have a key role to play. I said just now that you have to listen
            to the people. But your role does not end there. You also have
            to act as leaders.

            Left to themselves, people can easily remain trapped in narrow
            ideas of local or national interests, to be defended at all costs
            against the rival interests of outsiders. Your job is to put across
            a broader understanding of national interest. You have to explain
            the interest that all nations share in working together to promote
            such values as democracy, pluralism, human rights and - perhaps
            most important of all - the rule of law.

            International law is a fine concept. But it remains no more than
            that until it is effectively implemented by the international

            repeat: 500 international conventions. That sounds impressive,
            but only means anything when those conventions are given effect
            in national legislation. It is your task as parliamentarians,
            to do that - and you can only do it if you carry public opinion
            with you in understanding why it matters.

            Ladies and Gentlemen! Next year, as you all know, we celebrate
            the Millennium. That accident of calendar has given us an opportunity
            to do something unique. Many of you may also know that this momentous
            date will be marked, in the autumn, by a
          </note>
          <note>
            Millennium Summit of heads of state or government from all the
            Member States of the United Nations.
          </note>
          <note>
            My hope is that this will not be a purely ceremonial event, but
            an occasion for the human race to come together and rethink its
            priorities as we embark on a new century. I hope, in particular,
            that it will help us to think out more clearly the goals of the
          </note>
          <note>
            United Nations, and the strategies it will need to achieve those
            goals.
          </note>
          <note>
            For such hopes to be realized, we need careful preparation. Above
            all, we need bold and imaginative thinking. I myself intend to
            make my contribution, and I am sure that governments will do their
            part. But
          </note>
          <note>
            I know that if we are to succeed we have to cast our net wider
            than that.
          </note>
          <note>
            Non-governmental organizations have eagerly taken up the challenge,
            and will be holding a Millennium Forum at the United Nations Headquarters
            in the summer of next year. But you, the parliamentarians, must
            also have a vital contribution to make. I am delighted to hear
            that the Speakers of all the world's parliaments also plan to
            hold a meeting. I urge you all to contribute your ideas, and as
            far as possible to combine them in constructive and realistic
            propositions that will challenge ut to act.
          </note>
          <note>
            By "realistic" I do not mean defeatist or halfhearted. True realism
            springs from a combination of courage and creativity and I hope
            next year, when we all meet, we will be challenging ourselves.

            Perhaps, Madam Speaker, you can allow me one more word on Kosovo
            to say that I know Kosovo is on all our minds. Great many activities
            are taking place in search of a political solution. I visited
            Macedonia and Albania a week ago. It was a really painful experience.
            I was able to hear first hand horrible stories and heartbreaking
            stories from Kosovo.

            Earlier that day I had had discussions with the government of
            Macedonia encouraging it to allow the refugees to come, to keep
            the borders open and to accept them as refugees and not as deportees,
            as some would describe them, who had no rights. They are deportees,
            they are refugees, and they are entitled to their rights.

            I did talk about the human rights. Madam Speaker! You referred
            to the fiftieth anniversary of the
          </note>
          <note>
            Universal Declaration of Human Rights. If those rights had been
            respected the kosovars would not be where they are today. The
            human tragedy we are witnessing in Kosovo is fundamentally a human
            right's tragedy. Yes, it is a humanitarian tragedy, but it is
            fundamentally a human right's tragedy.

            take a resolution on the topic. But what is important, I think,
            is that everyone now believes the parties should turn to the

            a solution.

          <note>
            At the beginning when the Security Council was ignored, we all
            were worried and anxious that it had weakened the Council. If
            they now turn to the Council for a solution, and the Council helps
            bring about a solution, then what appeared to have weakened the

            Council. We hope sooner, rather than later. But that also implies
            that the Council and its members must be ready to do its duty

              Fru talman! Det är naturligt att dagens säkerhetspolitiska debatt
              präglas av Kosovo. Kriget i Kosovo är en tragedi. Varje dag påminns
              vi om människors lidande, flyktingar och de civila serberna. Men
              det faktum att det pågår ett krig i Europa utan att säkerhetsläget
              i Sverige påverkats visar att den svenska säkerhetspolitiken vilar
              på en stadig grund efter den positiva säkerhetspolitiska utvecklingen

              på att reformprocessen kommer att ta tid och på att den kan drabbas
              av bakslag. Samtidigt kan vi konstatera att det senaste årets
              allvarliga politiska kriser i Ryssland har kunnat lösas genom
              att alla politiska aktörer agerat inom ramen för den ryska författningen.

              Fru talman! Vilka lärdomar skall vi då dra av Kosovo? Den viktigaste
              lärdomen är att vi i världssamfundet måste utveckla förmågan att
              förebygga konflikter. Det har i och för sig gjorts mycket i Kosovo.
            </seg>
          </u>
          <u>
            <seg>
              Det har gällt beslut om sanktioner, resolutioner i säkerhetsrådet
              och stöd till demokratirörelser. Men det har inte gjorts tillräckligt
              mycket. Kosovo är ett tydligt exempel på att det behövs mycket
              mer av genomtänkt strategi för förebyggande.

              Omvärlden var inte tillräckligt tydlig när Milosevic beslutade
              om återtagande av autonomin för Kosovo och Vojvodina i mars 1989.
              Kosovo borde ha funnits med i Daytonöverenskommelsen. Självklart
              påminns vi här återigen om det klassiska dilemmat att uppmärksamheten,
              och därmed resurserna, handlingskraften och åtgärderna, har fokuserats
              på de akuta skeendena. Vi vet ju att några gram förebyggande motsvarar
              åtskilliga kilon kur efteråt. En huvuduppgift för en framåtblickande
              utrikes- och säkerhetspolitik är därför att bygga upp förebyggandets
              politiska vilja och att utveckla, vässa och förfina preventionens
              instrument.

              Det arbete med ett handlingsprogram för förebyggande av väpnade
              konflikter som jag anmälde för riksdagen i utrikesdeklarationen
              den 10 februari har nu avslutats i en första etapp. Jag hoppas
              att ni alla tar del av det och kommer med era synpunkter. Där

              Det tredje målet är att stärka det internationella normsystemet
              och dess tillämpning. Det handlar om att värna och utveckla folkrätt,
              demokrati och mänskliga rättigheter. Respekt för nationell suveränitet
              får inte stå i vägen för nödvändiga insatser för att förhindra
              humanitära katastrofer eller grova kränkningar av mänskliga rättigheter.
              Folkrätten måste gälla människors och inte bara staters säkerhet.

              Vårt fjärde mål syftar till att bättre utnyttja diplomatiska,
              politiska, ekonomiska och militära resurser för konfliktförebyggande
              insatser. Det behövs bättre metoder för kunskapsuppbyggnad, analys
              och preventiv diplomati. FN:s roll måste stärkas, och det krävs
              en tydligare arbetsfördelning mellan olika internationella organisationer.

              Det femte målet är att stärka den svenska kapaciteten. Det behövs
              mer av helhetssyn, och konfliktförebyggande skall tydligare integreras
              i utvecklingssamarbetet. Samverkan med folkrörelser och forskare
              skall öka.

              Dessa tankar är djupt förankrade i det svenska samhällets metoder
              för att utvecklas och förhindra väpnade konflikter. De blir nu
              en del av den aktiva politik som vi skall bidra med i de internationella
              sammanhang där vi verkar. Och alla dessa punkter påminner oss
              om Kosovo.

              Den andra viktiga lärdom vi kan dra av Kosovo är att EU måste
              stärka sin kapacitet för gemensam utrikespolitik och krishantering.
              När EU bildades i askan och ruinerna efter andra världskriget

              dragit ned på sina resurser. Man har svårt att klara det här.
              Europa är i dag mer beroende av USA kapacitetsmässigt än vad man
              var i början av 1990-talet. Parallellt med retoriken om vilket
              ansvar vi har, om hur viktigt det är att vi tar ansvar, urgröper
              vi vår möjlighet att fullt ut göra detta. Vi har inte den förmågan.
              Oavsett hur många mekanismer vi bygger upp och vad det står i

              komma samman och fylla fördragen med innehåll. Kan vi inte enas

              hållning till vapenexport och krigsmaterielexport därvidlag kommer

              att det är ett villkor för ett svenskt deltagande i ett utvidgat

              i större utsträckning ta på sig rollen som vapenmånglaren och

              eget område.

              den enda legitima organisation som har rätten att ingripa i mellanstatliga
              och inomstatliga konflikter är Förenta nationerna. Det kan ske

              till ett förslag till avtal i Rambouillet, hade det uppenbara

              Därmed hade Nato, utan att ha någon som helst plan för handlandet
              efter ett fredsavtal, satt sig i en sits där man för att rädda
              sitt eget anseende var tvungen att börja bomba. Det har fått de
              resultat vi ser - ökade civila offer, ökad folkfördrivning, ökad
              osäkerhet med Ryssland ställt åt sidan och FN-systemet kastat

              Fru talman! År efter år har vi kunnat se förtrycket av kosovoalbaner.
              Då borde det rimligtvis inte vara ett bra förhållningssätt att
              införa visumtvång för människor som vill fly från det förtrycket.

              Konflikthanteringen har lett till att Nato har tagit sig rätten

              Det är inte förvånande. Folkpartiet och dess ledare Lars Leijonborg
              har sagt att partiet är inte bara det mest EU-vänliga partiet
              i Sverige utan också det mest Amerikavänliga partiet. När det
              regnar i Washington spänner K-G Biörsmark upp paraplyet i Stockholm.
              Så USA-vänligt är Folkpartiet numera! Då ställer man också upp
              på en konflikthantering som leder till ett utdraget krig, mycket
              stora problem och svårigheter för civilbefolkningen, både den

              Men det finns något som är ännu viktigare. Det handlar om att
              vi också skall bygga strukturer så att vi inte ens behöver skicka
              förebyggande trupper. Jag tänker naturligtvis på de samarbetsstrukturer
              som vi bygger i Europa. Det är svårt att förstå Miljöpartiets
              engagemang när det gäller att vi skall förebygga samtidigt som
              Miljöpartiet vill dra sig ur något av det viktigaste när det gäller
              förebyggande, nämligen den europeiska unionen, vars hela syfte
              är att fläta ihop länderna, att skapa en samverkan som gör att
              vi inte hamnar i konflikt och krig med varandra. Det är oerhört

              Fru talman! Jag tror inte att det är så svårt att förstå varför
              Miljöpartiet vill dra sig ur EU. Det är helt riktigt som Göran
              Lennmarker säger att samarbetet mellan stater i sig är fredsskapande.
              Integration på olika plan mellan länder är fredsskapande och krigsförebyggande,
              och det finns många exempel i världen på s.k. säkerhetsgemenskaper
              där staters samarbete på olika plan har gjort att krig betraktas
              som en omöjlighet.

              sådant starkt samarbete och en sådan stark integration att vi
              betraktar krig som en omöjlighet. Det bör heller inte vara någon

              Det är viktigt att man också är med där andra länder är med.
              Man kan ju inte bygga upp ett samarbete bara med sig själv; man
              får acceptera de organisationer som finns med alla sina vårtor
              och blemmor och vad det nu är. Vi kan naturligtvis ha lite olika
              synpunkter på detta. FN har sina problem. OSSE har sina problem.
              EU har sina problem. Nato har sina problem. Visst är det så, men
              man måste ju faktiskt samarbeta där de andra länderna finns. Man
              kan ju inte sätta Sverige alldeles för sig självt och samarbeta
              för sig själv. Man måste vara med i de samarbetsorganisationer
              som finns. EU är, och växer alltmer fram som, en central del när
              det gäller att säkra frihet och fred i Europa. Varför vill Miljöpartiet

              Det ryska samhället har trots stora umbäranden alltmer stabiliserats
              i en demokratisk ordning, som visserligen behöver fördjupas och
              förstärkas men som finns där som en oåterkallelig process. Den
              ryska krigsmakten är kraftigt reducerad. Den skulle inte, skriver
              vi i betänkandet, kunna genomföra något invasionsföretag mot Sverige
              inom åtminstone en tioårsperiod. Ryssland deltar aktivt och konstruktivt
              i arbetet för att finna en politisk lösning på Kosovokonflikten.
              Även om moderaterna desperat försöker vifta lite med kommunistspöket
              igen eller åtminstone med Rysslands farlighet, biter det inte
              på majoriteten i utskottet. Vi menar att Ryssland inte i dag är
              ett militärt hot mot Sverige. Det är dags att revidera den svenska

              vårt närområde. Eller är det så att om Sverige känner ansvar utanför
              närområdet ställer vi upp, t.ex. i Kuwait och i Kosovo, och vi

              Herr talman! Militär alliansfrihet är inte ett uttryck för likgiltighet

              krigshot i närområdet, som Göran Lennmarker nu tar upp. Vi gör
              det genom Östersjösamarbetet. Vi gör det genom att starkt stödja
              och stimulera EU-utvidgningen för länderna runt Östersjön. Vi
              gör det genom förtroendeskapande minoritetsstöd till de här länderna.
              Vi gör det genom demokratibistånd. Vi gör det genom suveränitetsstöd

              När det gäller anslutning till CFE-avtalet vill regeringen avvakta

              upprustning. Jag tycker att det förhållningssättet står i bjärt

              sig till nedrustningsavtal. När Viola Furubjelke säger att det

              Herr talman! Folkrätten är inte enbart den självständiga statens
              suveränitet utan framför allt folkens rätt att få bli behandlade
              i enlighet med de mänskliga rättigheterna. I FN-stadgan finns
              en spänning mellan dessa två begrepp, men vi tycks mer och mer
              gå mot en tolkning där människans rätt till liv, värdig behandling
              och frihet får större betydelse än gränsernas relativa banalitet.
              Begreppet suveränitet kan väl rimligen bara ha ett värde om det
              bidrar till att skydda människornas integritet. Territoriell okränkbarhet
              får inte vara tyranniets hånfulla argument för att avvisa krav
              på att avrättning, tortyr, våldtäkter och fördrivning skall upphöra.

              till medling mellan Sydossetien och Georgien. Det handlar om möten

              Herr talman! Stödet till det civila samhället i fred är en viktig
              uppgift för försvaret framgent. Miljöhoten runtom i landet och
              i vår omvärld är stora. Samhället handskas med miljöfarliga varor,
              och transporter sker på land och på vattenvägar med allt större
              tonnage. Även inom industrin är kemikalieanvändandet stort. Det
              viktiga är naturligtvis att minska användandet och därmed behovet
              av transporter av dessa farliga varor, men också att förebygga
              olyckor. Vi har här i riksdagen alldeles nyligen fattat flera
              beslut som handlar om säkrare kemikaliehantering och kontroll,
              men olyckor kan ändå ske.

              1996 års försvarsbeslut var ett hafsverk med blicken riktad bakåt.
              Åtskilliga miljarder har lagts på att behålla anläggningar som
              vi redan då kunde se var helt bortkastade, men också på att utbilda
              åtskilliga tiotusentals värnpliktiga som inte fick någon plats

              Slutligen, fru talman, skulle jag vilja ta upp den fjärde punkten,
              vikten av att inrätta en insatsstyrka för nationella och internationella
              miljökatastrofer. En majoritet i riksdagen har ställt sig bakom
              att ett av de mer relevanta hoten är hotet mot miljön där det
              traditionella militära försvaret inte kan skydda oss.

              I Borås kommun har man tagit fram ett koncept för att utbilda
              människor i att hantera nationella och internationella miljökatastrofer.
              Vi i Miljöpartiet anser att det är en bra verksamhet. Vi ser dagligen
              exempel på var sådana här insatsstyrkor skulle kunna användas
              i FN:s regi, nu senast nere i Serbien i det forna Jugoslavien,
              där en av krigets konsekvenser är enorma oljeläckage och läckage
              från kemiska fabriker som påverkar miljön på Balkan på ett sätt
              som få i dag är medvetna om. Här skulle en internationell insatsenhet
              vara av stort värde. Det har vi också uttryckt i en motion från

              Allra sist, fru talman, skulle jag vilja ställa en fråga till
              Centerpartiet. Uppgörelsen med socialdemokratin innebär att man
              fortsättningsvis lägger stor vikt vid materielinköp. Vi har vapenbeställningar
              på uppemot 80-90 miljarder, vapen som motiveras med ett hot som
              alla säger inte längre finns. Det faktum att vi fortsätter att
              fullfölja t.ex. JAS-projektet får stora konsekvenser för regementena,
              som i ännu högre grad måste läggas ned runt om i kommunerna, och
              det i en snabbare takt än vad som hade behövts.

              med ett beslut som lägger tonvikten vid vapen- och materielköp,
              vilket drabbar just kommuner runt om i landet på ett kanske onödigt
              sätt. Detsamma gäller miljöbrigaden. Miljöpartiets motion har
              avstyrkts av också Centerpartiet. Hur rimmar det med Centerns
              försök att profilera sig som varandes miljöengagerat? Det vore

              Fru talman! Henrik Landerholm förvånas också över hur vi prioriterar
              ned det svenska försvaret, medan vi är angelägna om att Sverige
              skall kunna delta i internationella FN-uppdrag. Det finns inte
              längre något militärt hot mot Sverige som motiverar ett invasionsförsvar
              för 100 miljoner kronor om dagen. Då är den självklara slutsatsen
              att man prioriterar ned där. De pengar som vi satsat där behövs
              på andra områden i vårt samhälle - sjukvård, skola, barnomsorg.
              Det är bara att gå ut i kommunerna och se. Också Sverige måste
              kunna frigöra militära resurser för angelägnare områden. Samtidigt

              Fru talman! En fråga som alltid har varit svår att besvara i
              försvarsplaneringen är varför det behövs ett visst antal arméförband,
              fartygsförband och flygdivisioner för att klara försvarets uppgifter.
              Orsakskedjan har tidigare varit för lång och komplicerad för att
              kunna ge en tillfredsställande förklaring. Försvarsmakten har
              under våren presenterat en modell som kortfattat går ut på att
              bättre förklara sambandet mellan de uppgifter som riksdagen och
              regeringen fastställt och de krigsförband som skall organiseras.

              upp på förhandlingarna och höll ut nästan ända till slutet, men
              det berodde naturligtvis på att närstridsproblematiken och de
              akuta likviditetsproblemen skulle innebära alltför svåra påfrestningar

              att regeringen inte har kunnat ge besked till försvarsindustrin
              i det här läget? Jag är helt medveten om att det kommer att bli
              en omstrukturering i Europa, men att inte ge besked - vare sig

              Jag är glad över att Åke Carnerö tar upp frågan om försvarsindustrin.
              Jag har agerat med en utgångspunkt från december: Se till att
              så maximalt många ställningstaganden som över huvud taget går
              sker i samband med det att ÖB den 15 juni överlämnar sina förslag.
              Då har han möjlighet att väga vartenda materielsystem som ligger
              i förhållande till det behov av stridskrafter som han presenterade
              för någon vecka sedan och som vi - som det tidigare replikskiftet
              visade på - givetvis skall gå igenom. Så många ställningstaganden
              som över huvud taget är möjligt skall avvägas i en samlad process
              av chefen för Försvarsmakten, av regeringen och därefter - i förekommande
              fall - av riksdagen.

              projekt som var så tidskritiska att de absolut skulle släppas
              fram före den 15 juni. Men i några fall har argumenten varit så
              starka att regeringen har gett olika former av medgivanden för
              att man skulle kunna gå vidare.

              om man inte får ett besked ger detta en signal till eventuella

              en signal till utlandet om att man får avvakta. Det innebär att
              kompetens försvinner, vilket leder till en mycket prekär situation,
              och att klarhet därför bör ges så tidigt som möjligt.

              Jag förstod inte heller riktigt Centerpartiets resonemang när
              det gäller miljöbrigader. Visst är det så att lagstiftningen i
              dag hindrar upprättandet av insatsenheter för att hantera miljökatastrofer
              nationellt och internationellt. Men det kan ju inte vara ett argument
              för att behålla det som det är. I så fall är det väl, som Miljöpartiet
              har förespråkat, anledning att ändra lagstiftningen.

              miljöprofil som Centern gärna vill ha. Men när det kommer till
              praktisk handling avslår man Miljöpartiets motion om att sätta
              upp en sådan här miljöbrigad och se till att ändra lagstiftningen

              Sedan 1994 har tågordningen varit en annan. Först har den ekonomiska

              eller mindre fått rätta sig därefter. Även om majoriteten i Försvarsberedningen
              inte varje dag medvetet sneglat på miljarderna kan man inte undgå
              att påverkas av de direktiv om ekonomin som regeringen tidigare
              har lagt. Så har det också varit inför det beslut som skall tas

              i nedskuret anslag med 4 miljarder kronor per år också i en obalans
              mellan uppgift och ekonomi. Det ledde till minskad utbildning

              riksdagens beslut om kompensation till Försvarsmakten för ändringen
              av anslagsförordningen. Om det sedan gällde 2 eller 3 miljarder
              kronor per år kan vi lämna därhän men Försvarsmaktens planerade
              verksamhet och investeringar omkullkastades på mycket kort tid.

              till att köpa flygplan från något annat land. Det sydafrikanska
              parlamentet hade ju redan beslutat om att anskaffa flygplan och

              Jag bedömer att flygplanet har stora möjligheter på exportmarknaderna,
              eftersom kombinationen av pris och prestanda är mycket fördelaktig.
              Många, framför allt mindre, länder har inte råd att satsa på flygplan
              av den storlek, dignitet och kostnad som bl.a. prövas just nu
              i Kosovo.

              Fru talman! De flesta bedömare anser att ett invasionshot mot

              är har jag varken hört eller sett. Här kommer väl ett av problemen
              i den här debatten, nämligen att det saknas en grundläggande analys
              av hoten och möjligheterna och behoven av att möta dem, så att
              angripare verkligen blir bemötta och avväpnade. Den hotbild som

              överlevnad. När situationen var som svårast och det offentliga
              systemet mer eller mindre rasade ihop, växte det snabbt upp ett
              frivilligt nätverk eller system som tog tag i olika verksamhetsområden.
              Det gällde barnomsorg, äldrevård, sjukvård, social omvårdnad,

              sammanhängande planeringsförutsättningen. ÖB, liksom de flesta

              bedömning som regeringen presenterat inte stämmer med nuvarande
              faktiska situation. Säger regeringen nej till en omprövning eller
              bortser från konsekvenserna av en annan bedömning, innebär det
              att det svenska försvaret planeras utifrån felaktiga förutsättningar.

              Fru talman! Juholt har säker läst denna också, nämligen Förändrad
              omvärld - omdanat försvar, rapport från Försvarsberedningen inför
              1999 års kontrollstation. Där är man mycket tydlig när det gäller
              anpassningen. Man skriver: Tanken bakom anpassningsfilosofin för
              försvaret är att tidiga signaler rörande förändringar i vår säkerhetspolitiska
              situation skall kunna upptäckas i så god tid att vi står väl rustade
              när förändringarna har inträffat. Det torde inte vara lätt att
              få denna filosofi att fungera i det praktiska arbetet. Det finns
              internationellt många exempel på att förvarningssignalerna inte
              har uppfattats eller att man inte har tagit hänsyn till dem.

              Fru talman! Det allra sämsta sättet att använda försvarsanslag
              och materielanskaffningspengar vore att nu avveckla Bamsesystemet.
              Det är ett system som vi nu har plöjt ned 2 miljarder kronor i.
              Det är ett system som vi har investerat betydande kompetens och
              kunnande i, som har stor exportpotential och stor möjlighet att
              dra in pengar till svensk industri och ge svenska jobb. Att i

              Det skulle innebära att försvarsförmågan som ligger i det systemet

              för rehabilitering kanske skall organiseras på annat sätt och
              läggas på någon annan än Försvarsmakten, som ju har väldigt mycket
              att genomföra de närmaste åren, är hårt belastad av stora neddragningar
              och skall avskeda 10 000 människor.

              Sverige har, fru talman, kunnat bidra i många missioner som hjälpt
              till med försvar av frihet, mänskliga rättigheter och fred. Det
              är en stor uppgift för de unga män och kvinnor som tjänstgör i
              Sveriges utlandsstyrka. Om vi vill bidra med säkerhetsfrämjande
              styrkor måste vi också, fru talman, vara beredda att ta ansvar
              för ett försäkringsskydd som är så tydligt utformat att den enskilde
              enkelt kan ta ställning till risker och förmåner. De som åtar
              sig att tjänstgöra i utlandsstyrkan måste kunna vara säkra på
              att de har ett fullgott försäkringsskydd som gäller.

              Fru talman! Ärade ledamöter och åhörare! Under denna dag har
              vi brutit åsikter mot varandra när det gäller säkerhets- och försvarspolitiken,
              men vi har varit överens i någon mening. Det gäller åsikten att
              vi bör satsa på fredsbefrämjande och fredsbevarande missioner.

              Vi har en lång tradition på detta område här i Sverige. Sveriges
              rykte, i egenskap av neutral och alliansfri stat, kan betyda mycket
              för fredsarbetet ute i världen.

              Den nyinriktning av försvarspolitiken som vi skall besluta om
              innebär på sikt också ett utökat engagemang inom detta område,
              med alltfler i utlandsstyrkan i framtiden. Därför är det så oerhört
              viktigt att skyddet för de unga män och kvinnor som på FN:s eller
              OSSE:s uppdrag genomför detta ansvarsfulla och viktiga arbete
              är det absolut bästa skydd man kan få.

              Att förebygga skador är absolut det viktigaste av allt. God utbildning
              och noggrant förarbete är därför a och o, och likaså att de lagar
              om arbetsmiljö och arbetarskydd som kan tillämpas ute i en internationell
              mission också efterlevs.

              Risken att skadas och invalidiseras i samband med tjänst i utlandsstyrkan
              är trots detta större än i många andra riskfyllda arbeten. När
              de dessutom går ut i en frivillig mission för fredens skull och
              för allas vår strävan efter en bättre situation i omvärlden är
              ansvaret för oss naturligtvis än tyngre. Därför är regeringens
              initiativ på området både nödvändigt och mycket efterlängtat.

              Vi ansåg t.ex. att livränteunderlaget skulle vara sju basbelopp
              i stället för, som föreslagits, fem. Att man har valt just fem
              basbelopp kan bero på att lönen för några år sedan motsvarade
              just fem basbelopp, men man hade en massa tillägg som inte var
              beskattade och därmed inte heller pensionsgrundande. Nu har man
              ändrat systemet, och lönen motsvarar nu sju basbelopp; man har
              tagit bort alla dessa tillägg.

            <seg>
              Åsikten om att det skulle vara sju basbelopp delades av de flesta
              av oss. Utskottets förslag sammanfaller därför med Vänsterpartiets
              i denna del, vilket vi är väldigt glada över.

              Försvarsmaktens rehabiliteringsansvar skall enligt regeringens
              förslag omfatta tre år med möjlighet till en förlängning på två
              år. Även om det gavs en liten möjlighet att utöka det här ansvaret
              ansåg vi inte att det var tillräckligt. Det är inte orimligt att
              tänka sig att den skadade har behov av en mycket längre rehabiliteringstid,
              även om det kan räcka med den här tiden för de flesta, men att
              Försvarsmakten anser att det räcker med tre plus två år, dvs.
              fem år, som är inskrivet. Det skulle då kunna uppkomma en konflikt
              mellan den som skulle behöva den här rehabiliteringen och Försvarsmakten.
              Och vi vet hur det brukar bli i sådana här sammanhang. Det är
              den enskilde som kommer i kläm. De i utlandsstyrkan riskerar också
              att få psykiska bekymmer senare, och psykiska skador som beror
              på upplevelser som de har haft i sin mission kan komma ganska
              långt efter det att de har kommit hem, och de kan också bli akuta.
              Därför ansåg vi att det, när det gäller Försvarsmaktens rehabiliteringsansvar,
              borde vara en individuell prövning och att man därför inte borde
              ha så snäva och klara gränser. En individuell prövning skulle
              också vara tryggare för den enskilde, om behovet uppkommer.

              Fru talman! Vänsterpartiet hade också i sin motion om utlandsstyrkan
              en mängd olika förslag för att förbättra de anhörigas möjligheter.
              Det gäller i första hand ersättningen för de anhöriga. Det är
              oerhört viktigt att de närmaste har möjlighet att vara den skadade
              till hjälp både i det akuta skedet och under kanske en lång och
              svår rehabiliteringstid. Närheten av en eller flera anhöriga kan
              vara den faktor som ger den skadade livsmod och styrka att kämpa
              vidare, att jobba på. Men det här har också en stor betydelse
              när det gäller att förebygga framtida psykiska komplikationer.
              Därför ansåg vi att regeringen var för njugg i fråga om ersättningsnivåerna
              och retroaktiviteten när det gällde stödet till de anhöriga. Vi
              ville också trycka mycket hårdare än regeringen på Försvarsmaktens
              ansvar för rehabiliteringsinsatserna.

              Dessa åsikter fick vi inte stöd för i utskottet. Vi kan i viss
              mån hålla med om att det är viktigt att dessa nya regler kan tillämpas
              så snabbt som möjligt. Vi hade ganska omfattande förslag, och
              vi tycker fortfarande att de var riktiga, men dessa ändringar
              skulle kunna försena arbetet. Därför har vi valt att avge ett
              yttrande i det här avseendet. Men eftersom det skall bli en uppföljning
              av ärendet och av lagen ges det en möjlighet att senare komma
              med förslag om förbättringar om det visar sig vara nödvändigt.
              Därför kommer vi nogsamt att följa detta ärende i framtiden.

              tidigare. Det är unga män och kvinnor som kanske kommer direkt
              från en värnpliktstjänstgöring eller något annat, och därför faller
              de inte under den allmänna arbetsskadeförsäkringen och det ansvar

              Lagens tillämpningsområde innebär en avgränsning. Det gör att

              Det är en brist. Det finns i och för sig inget hinder för regeringen
              att särskilt besluta att de som genomför uppdrag åt myndigheter
              eller regering också skall omfattas av samma rehabiliteringsbestämmelser
              som gäller för utlandsstyrkan och att det också skulle kunna gälla

              Fru talman! Vad som först såg ut att bli en fullödig debatt mellan

              Vi skall i dag avhandla något så viktigt som en ny försäkringsrörelselagstiftning.
              Försäkringsbranschen är mycket intressant. Det är en dynamisk
              tillväxtmarknad, som utvecklas väldigt snabbt och som har varit
              stadd i förändring under hela 90-talet. När man talar om försäkringsbranschen
              får man använda ett begrepp som "branschglidning", något som indikerar
              att försäkringar inte är en mot andra branscher tydligt avgränsad
              enskild bransch. Försäkringsorgan ägnar sig i dag väldigt mycket
              åt att placera sparpengar, vilket ibland liknar bankverksamhet.

              Vi har också kunnat se en hel del fusioner där försäkrings- och
              bankmarknaden integreras på ett sätt som gör att det i dag ibland
              är lite svårt att säga vad som är specifikt just för försäkringsbranschen.

              Detta påverkar naturligtvis också vilken typ av lagstiftning
              som vi skall genomföra i Sveriges riksdag. Om vi har viktiga marknader
              som på det här sättet är i utveckling och det sker en branschglidning,
              är det svårt att ha branschspecifika lagstiftningar, som reser
              höga murar mot andra områden. Detta måste prägla vår syn på förändringarna
              i dagens lagstiftning.

              Propositionen som avlämnats kommer mycket sent. Det finns underlag
              i form av utredningar som har fått vänta länge på avgörande, och
              när propositionen väl har lagts fram är den sällsynt behäftad
              med ord som "skjuta upp", "titta på senare" och "utreda vidare",
              vilket gör att det avstamp som många trodde att den nya försäkringsrörelselagstiftningen
              skulle bli till stora delar har kommit att utebli. Man får nu
              fortsätta att vänta på ställningstaganden. Det gäller de viktiga
              frågor som här tas upp. Bl.a. när det gäller konsolideringsfondens
              framtid hänvisas det till fortsatta överväganden. Det hänvisas
              också till en översyn av associationsrättsliga regler, som påverkar
              väldigt mycket av det som står i propositionen. Det står också
              att man på ett mer grundläggande sätt skall se över nuvarande
              placeringsregler, och därför föreslås inga förändringar.

              och att inte heller då, tycker vi, stanna vid att nationellt avskärma
              Sverige med en avvikande lagstiftning trots att detta rör frågor

              uppmuntra en uppförandekodex, vilket det finns ett stort intresse
              av också hos aktörerna själva, och att uppmuntra konkurrens för
              att kunder skall få bästa möjlighet att byta och att se skillnader

              Detta präglar väldigt mycket även denna proposition. Vi har därför
              i en del reservationer kommit att landa på avvikande uppfattningar.
              Det gäller dels den s.k. konsolideringsfonden. Den av en del motsedda
              förändringen att också vinstutdelande livförsäkringsbolag skulle
              kunna få bygga upp en konsolideringsfond uteblev. Man har nu valt
              en reglering som många menar gynnar vissa aktörer på försäkringsmarknaden
              - läs s.k. ömsesidiga bolag, och det största som vi känner i den

              Vi har försökt att ta hänsyn till att det naturligtvis skulle
              kunna föras i bevis att det finns oro för att ett vinstutdelande
              bolag som får bygga upp, konsolidera, en fond med hjälp av premier
              skulle kunna dela ut premiepengar till ägarna och att det kanske
              skulle uppfattas som stötande. Vi har därför föreslagit en variant
              där man gör klart att man först skall använda den buffert som
              ägarkapital har skjutit till innan det kan bli tal om att ta i
              anspråk premieavsatta pengar.

              av bolag som har vinstutdelande politik.

              Vad gäller femprocentsregeln fick vi ett domstolsutslag som i
              ett slag upphävde den svenska femprocentsregeln. Vi lever nu i
              något så märkligt som ett laglöst tillstånd, då det nu egentligen
              inte finns någon klar definition av vad som är s.k. försäkringsfrämmande
              ägande eller koppling till andra företag. Det är inte okomplicerat
              för ett försäkringsbolag att ha ett betydande ägaransvar i börsnoterade
              aktiebolag. Det medför en lång rad ansvarstaganden som egentligen
              inte följer av att man placerar livförsäkringspengar till för
              kunderna bästa avkastning. Vi har försökt att ge uttryck för detta
              och sagt att här måste man se hela den diskussion som förs i Sverige
              om ifall det gynnar det institutionella sparandet och att det
              är olyckligt att institutioner och utländska ägare är mer skattemässigt
              gynnade än privatpersoner som försöker äga svenska aktier i Sverige.

              Vi tycker dock att femprocentsregeln, vilket också uttrycks i

              konkurrensnackdel för Sverige på denna globala öppna marknad.
              Det vore dock intressant att i dag få någon sorts besked om vad
              som komma skall i stället. Jag har under dagen inhämtat uppgifter

              är på väg i början av juni för en proposition ungefär vid midsommar.

              Europa har inneburit en ökad konkurrens på den svenska marknaden.
              Av denna anledning framstår dagens regleringar när det gäller
              skälighets- och sundhetsprinciper som mindre lämpliga, eftersom
              de i påtaglig grad har hämmat nyetableringar och produktutveckling

              Det finns en grundläggande skillnad mellan ömsesidiga försäkringsbolag

              I de ömsesidiga försäkringsbolagen är försäkringstagarna delägare.

              stå för riskkapitalet och betala om verksamheten sköts dåligt.

              allmänt riskkapital om rörelsen går sämre än väntat samtidigt

              Men den frågan behandlas inte i propositionen. Flertalet av de
              av reservanterna här upptagna frågorna rör avtalsrättsliga frågeställningar
              som i första hand bör prövas inom ramen för en ny försäkringsavtalslagstiftning

              intresseorganisationer att träffa fördelaktiga försäkringsavtal

              hjälp för många medlemmar den dag som t.ex. en brand eller annan
              skada inträffar. I många andra sammanhang tecknas ju också kollektiva
              försäkringar, t.ex. av varuhus, idrottsanläggningar eller föreningar.
              Dessa försäkringar gäller för besökare i allmänhet eller för medlemmarnas
              räkning, t.ex. för olycksfall, trots att de personer som skyddas

              som förs fram ständigt. Det är en ringaktning av ett system som
              innebär mycket stora ekonomiska fördelar och riskspridning för
              grupper som annars skulle stå oskyddade. Det är grunden för det
              kollektiva skyddet. Det tycker vi är värt att slå vakt om. Det
              finns ingen anledning att ingripa. Det finns en reservationsrätt.
              Den som inte vill vara med har den möjligheten.

              När det gäller konsolideringsfonden i vinstutdelande livförsäkringsbolag
              är det viktigt att klargöra att det är stor skillnad mellan olika
              typer av bolag. Det finns ingen anledning att försäkringstagarna
              skall stå för riskerna i svåra situationer, när bolagen går med
              förlust, och att aktieägarna sedan skall plocka hem vinsterna
              när det går bra. Det måste finnas en klar distinktion.

              Fru talman! Det är riktigt att en hel del förändringar föreslås.
              Som jag nämnde i min inledning bygger de på utredningar som har
              jobbat under lång tid. Det har varit väl känt att många av förändringarna
              skall komma. De har också mottagits väl av försäkringsbranschen.

              Det viktiga är att ligga i framkant och möta den nya tidens krav,
              för att få försäkringsbranschen att växa och bli starkare. Det
              kan leda till fler jobb och att vi får en intressant marknad med
              försäkringsprodukter som förstärker konsumenternas möjligheter
              att välja. Det är det vi har sett framför oss.

              Risken med avgränsningen av konsolideringsfonden är att vinstutdelande
              bolag kommer att dra öronen åt sig och inte utveckla en del av
              de produkter de annars skulle utvecklat. Det har talats om att
              det inte blir samma goda tillgång till riskkapital i de små och
              medelstora företagen, som en följd av att man inte gick hela vägen.
              Man borde ha varit mer lyhörd för det när man valde att lagstifta.

              Fru talman! Att underlätta produktutveckling, ge bättre förutsättningar

              Det görs en distinktion mellan utdelande och icke utdelande bolag.
              Det finns ingen anledning att i panik införa nya regler för att
              åstadkomma en skenbar konkurrensneutralitet. Vinstutdelande bolag
              och icke vinstutdelande bolag drivs under helt olika förutsättningar.
              Det är en uppenbar risk att pengar slussas över från försäkringstagare
              till aktieägare på ett olämpligt sätt. Det inser man också i en
              moderatmotion. Då är det bättre att avvakta den översyn som aviseras
              inom Finansdepartementet om bl.a. konsolideringsfondens framtid.
