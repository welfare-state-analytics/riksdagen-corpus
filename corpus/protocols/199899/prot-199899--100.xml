            Mr Secretary-General,
          </note>
          <note>
            During my five years as Speaker of the Riksdag, we have arranged
            solemn ceremonies in this Chamber celebrating the fiftieth anniversary
            of the United
          </note>
          <note>
            Nations, of the United Nations' Declaration on Human Rights and
            - only a few weeks ago - the Council of Europe.
          </note>
          <note>
            The purpose of these manifestations has been to demonstrate the
            strong and unwavering support of the
          </note>
          <note>
            Riksdag and the Swedish people for the struggle against war and
            violence for human rights and human dignity.
          </note>
          <note>
            One of the very pillars of Swedish foreign policy is the belief
            in and support to the United Nations. For this reason the Secretary-
            General of the United Nations is the only person outside the Riksdag
            and the
          </note>
          <note>
            Swedish Government who may be invited to address this Chamber.

            Mr Secretary-General,
          </note>
          <note>
            We are right now living in a critical period of time, when we
            are forced to observe serious breaches of the peace, which we
            all desire, and disrespect for human rights, human dignity and
            even human lives.
          </note>
          <note>
            In this complicated and difficult situation it is growing more
            and more obvious that we all need to cooperate in strengthening
            our common global organisation - the United Nations.
          </note>
          <note>
            Mr Secretary-General and dear friend,
          </note>
          <note>
            It is with great admiration that we have followed your personal
            contributions to the important work of the United Nations - both
            in terms of the reform process that you initiated and of the courageous
            political initiatives you have undertaken to solve complex and
            dangerous situations.
          </note>
          <note>
            It is a great privilege of the Riksdag - and the
          </note>
          <note>
            Swedish people - to be allowed to listen to you today.
          </note>
          <note>
            We will do it with the greatest interest and dedication.

            Mr Secretary-General,

          <note>
            It is always a great honour to be invited to address the Parliament
            of a Member State. Today that honour is combined, for me, with
            a kind of homecoming -
          </note>
          <note>
            not just because I am married to a Swede, but because the United
            Nations has a close family relationship with the whole nation
            of Sweden.
          </note>
          <note>
            This country is not only an island of stability in an unstable
            world, it is also a bastion of solidarity.
          </note>
          <note>
            Throughout the history of the United Nations, you have shown
            exemplary commitment to its goals and activities: to peacekeeping
            and peacemaking, to development and international law, to human
            security and human rights. By doing so, you have helped people
            far beyond your borders feel that the world is a safer place.
          </note>
          <note>
            Today, your solidarity is more important than ever. Safety and
            stability are in short supply not only on other continents, but
            even in parts of Europe, as you, Madam Speaker, referred to earlier.
          </note>
          <note>
            In this day and age, people in different parts of the world are
            directly affected by each other's actions more than ever before
            in human history.

            An automobile may be assembled in one continent from parts manufactured
            in two or more others. Billions of dollars are moved across the
            world in seconds by pressing a few keys on a computer terminal.

          <note>
            A sporting event or a rock concert can be watched in real time
            by thousands of people miles away. So also can scenes of war and
            terrible suffering.
          </note>
          <note>
            Like almost everything else in life, this phenomenon has good
            and bad aspects. It brings us many opportunities to learn from
            each other and to benefit from a wider range of choices.
          </note>
          <note>
            But it can also seem threatening. Workers may find their jobs
            made suddenly obsolete by imported technology or foreign competition.
            Parents find their children attracted by products and role models
            from foreign cultures or alien cultures, as some call it.
          </note>
          <note>
            Sometimes the world even seems to be losing its spice and variety.
            Instead of widening our choices, globalization can seem to be
            forcing us all into the same shallow, consumerist culture - giving
            us all the same appetites but leaving us more unequal than ever
            in our ability to satisfy them.
          </note>
          <note>
            That feeling accounts for much of the fear and anger we see in
            today's world. In many places, very destructive forces have been
            unleashed. We like to call them inhuman, but in reality they are
            all too human: They are one of the ways our human nature reacts
            when we feel ourselves threatened.
          </note>
          <note>
            These are global challenges, which need global solutions, hammered
            out multilaterally, so that all states accept them as legitimate,
            and feel committed to implementing them.
          </note>
          <note>
            There has to be a forum where these issues can be debated openly
            - where all participants can feel they have a say. You will not
            be surprised to hear me say that that forum is the United Nations.
          </note>
          <note>
            Of course it is not easy. There are times when the process of
            reaching agreement in the United Nations seems too slow and cumbersome
            as to make swift, decisive action impossible. And then States
            feel that they are justified in taking the law into their own
            hands - as the members of Nato did when they took unilateral action,
            rather than watch the horrors continue in Kosovo unchecked.
          </note>
          <note>
            I fully understood that feeling. In this age when the power of
            states to control their economy or their environment is limited
            by global forces, surely we cannot allow their one unchallenged
            power to be that of persecuting their own citizens?
          </note>
          <note>
            On the day the action began, I expressed my own frustration at
            the rejection of a political settlement by the Yugoslav authorities,
            and said that "there are times when the use of force may be legitimate
            in the pursuit of peace."
          </note>
          <note>
            But I also reminded the world, with equal emphasis, that under
            the Charter of the United Nations it is the Security Council which
            has primary responsibility for maintaining international peace
            and security.
          </note>
          <note>
            As the conflict has developed, there are today two principles
            on which all parties seem to agree. One is that the Kosovar Albanians
            must be enabled to return to their homes in safety, with their
            security and political and human rights internationally guaranteed
            and protected. The other is that ultimately such issues of war
            and peace must be settled within the framework of the United Nations.
          </note>
          <note>
            The sooner we can reach a political solution giving effect to
            both those principles the better it will be for everyone, and
            especially for the suffering people of Yugoslavia, whatever their
            ethnic affiliation.
          </note>
          <note>
            Ever since 1945, the United Nations Charter has provided the
            recognized and indispensable framework of international co-operation.
            If anything, that has been even more true since the end of the
            Cold
          </note>
          <note>
            War, which removed the biggest obstacle to such cooperation.
          </note>
          <note>
            Increasingly, not only Governments but people the world over
            have looked to the United Nations, as the forum in which agreements
            can be reached to safeguard their interests.

            You as parliamentarians know this. You are elected by the people,

            You are often the medium through which civil society makes its

          <note>
            Sweden, and elsewhere, attach to "Agenda 21" - the principles
            of sustainable development agreed at the
          </note>
          <note>
            UN Rio Conference, in 1992.
          </note>
          <note>
            You know well how much people care about the barbarity of anti-personnel
            landmines. It was pressure from your constituents, alongside many
            thousands of others, that pushed governments to sign the Ottawa
          </note>
          <note>
            Convention.
          </note>
          <note>
            It is partly thanks to you, and other parliaments around the
            world, that the Convention is now in force, having been ratified
            by more than the 60 requisite countries. I hope that other parliaments
            will soon follow your example, particularly those of several major
            landmine producing and exporting countries which are not yet parties
            to the Convention.
          </note>
          <note>
            To give one more example, you know well how strongly Swedish
            people feel - as do those in many other countries - about the
            crimes against humanity whose authors too often get away scot-free,
            as though the murder of a thousand people were somehow less culpable
            than that of one. It was thanks to popular pressure from all over
            the world that governments agreed in Rome last summer on the Statute
            of the
          </note>
          <note>
            International Criminal Court. I urge you and your fellow parliamentarians
            around the world to speed up the process of ratification of the
            Rome Statute. We must not loose the momentum in bringing this
            extraordinary achievement into fruition at the earliest possible
            date.
          </note>
          <note>
            I hope that the court will be ratified and that we can begin
            to function by december 2000. It will be a wonderful gift to give
            to future generations, particulary as we enter a new millennium.
          </note>
          <note>
            Your constituents understand, I believe, how important it is
            for a global society to have shared norms and values, codified
            in a framework of international law - just as a national community
            can only survive so long as its members agree on certain core
            values which are reflected in domestic law. Without shared values,
            without agreed norms it is very difficult to hold a community
            together. This in my judgement applies to the international level
            and what we call the international community.
          </note>
          <note>
            What they may not realize is how much the United Nations does,
            in quiet, unreported ways, to provide the world community with
            a framework of codified international law.

            Even in this learned assembly, I suspect there are some members
            who have not heard of UNCITRAL -
          </note>
          <note>
            the United Nations Commission on International
          </note>
          <note>
            Trade Law. Yet this body plays an essential role in facilitating
            international trade and reducing transaction costs, through its
            work of standardizing the laws which govern commercial transactions.
            It is one of many parts of the United Nations system that establish,
            maintain and gradually extend the "soft infrastructure", making
            possible the international exchange of goods, money and information.
          </note>
          <note>
            When people say the United Nations is "no longer relevant", I
            believe they overlook, or underrate, the importance of such contributions
            to global governance.

            Tomorrow, at the University of Lund, I shall speak at greater

          </note>
          <note>
            Nations in upholding human rights and humanitarian law. Today
            I just want to remind you that these form part of a wider principle:
            It is respect for the rule of law which distinguishes a civilized,
            secure society from an anarchic one.
          </note>
          <note>
            That is true for countries, and in the end it must be true for
            the emerging international order as well. If we do not have established
            rules and procedures, or if we fail to abide by them, we are condemned
            to live by the law of the jungle, in which the strong devour the
            weak. It was to save humanity from that fate that the United Nations
            was set up in the first place.

            In this vital task of global governance, you parliamentarians
            have a key role to play. I said just now that you have to listen
            to the people. But your role does not end there. You also have
            to act as leaders.

            Left to themselves, people can easily remain trapped in narrow
            ideas of local or national interests, to be defended at all costs
            against the rival interests of outsiders. Your job is to put across
            a broader understanding of national interest. You have to explain
            the interest that all nations share in working together to promote
            such values as democracy, pluralism, human rights and - perhaps
            most important of all - the rule of law.

          <note>
            repeat: 500 international conventions. That sounds impressive,
            but only means anything when those conventions are given effect
            in national legislation. It is your task as parliamentarians,
            to do that - and you can only do it if you carry public opinion
            with you in understanding why it matters.

            Ladies and Gentlemen! Next year, as you all know, we celebrate
            the Millennium. That accident of calendar has given us an opportunity
            to do something unique. Many of you may also know that this momentous
            date will be marked, in the autumn, by a
          </note>
          <note>
            Millennium Summit of heads of state or government from all the
            Member States of the United Nations.
          </note>
          <note>
            My hope is that this will not be a purely ceremonial event, but
            an occasion for the human race to come together and rethink its
            priorities as we embark on a new century. I hope, in particular,
            that it will help us to think out more clearly the goals of the
          </note>
          <note>
            United Nations, and the strategies it will need to achieve those
            goals.
          </note>
          <note>
            For such hopes to be realized, we need careful preparation. Above
            all, we need bold and imaginative thinking. I myself intend to
            make my contribution, and I am sure that governments will do their
            part. But
          </note>
          <note>
            I know that if we are to succeed we have to cast our net wider
            than that.
          </note>
          <note>
            Non-governmental organizations have eagerly taken up the challenge,
            and will be holding a Millennium Forum at the United Nations Headquarters
            in the summer of next year. But you, the parliamentarians, must
            also have a vital contribution to make. I am delighted to hear
            that the Speakers of all the world's parliaments also plan to
            hold a meeting. I urge you all to contribute your ideas, and as
            far as possible to combine them in constructive and realistic
            propositions that will challenge ut to act.
          </note>
          <note>
            By "realistic" I do not mean defeatist or halfhearted. True realism
            springs from a combination of courage and creativity and I hope
            next year, when we all meet, we will be challenging ourselves.

            You Swedes have shown that many times in your remarkable history,
            and in your dazzling contributions to peace and development worldwide.
            Let me conclude by paying a special tribute to those many, many
            Swedes who have placed their courage and creativity at the service
            of the United Nations.

            Others, of course, are no longer with us. Some, like
          </note>
          <note>
            Dag Hammarskjöld and Folke Bernadotte, even gave their lives
            in the cause of peace.
          </note>
          <note>
            In preparing for the new Millennium, let us all draw inspiration
            from their example.

            Perhaps, Madam Speaker, you can allow me one more word on Kosovo
            to say that I know Kosovo is on all our minds. Great many activities
            are taking place in search of a political solution. I visited
            Macedonia and Albania a week ago. It was a really painful experience.
            I was able to hear first hand horrible stories and heartbreaking
            stories from Kosovo.
          </note>
          <note>
            A hundred-year-old woman, uprooted that day, sitting on the road
            not knowing what happened to her, why she is where she was and
            where she was going.
          </note>
          <note>
            A mother with a baby who had been born when she had been on the
            run for two months, three weeks old, seeking refuge i Macedonia.
          </note>
          <note>
            Earlier that day I had had discussions with the government of
            Macedonia encouraging it to allow the refugees to come, to keep
            the borders open and to accept them as refugees and not as deportees,
            as some would describe them, who had no rights. They are deportees,
            they are refugees, and they are entitled to their rights.
          </note>
          <note>
            I did talk about the human rights. Madam Speaker! You referred
            to the fiftieth anniversary of the
          </note>
          <note>
            Universal Declaration of Human Rights. If those rights had been
            respected the kosovars would not be where they are today. The
            human tragedy we are witnessing in Kosovo is fundamentally a human
            right's tragedy. Yes, it is a humanitarian tragedy, but it is
            fundamentally a human right's tragedy.

            I hope we will succeed in getting them back home for the summer.
            There are some difficult details to be worked out, differences
            between the GA to be sorted out, before the Security Council can
            take a resolution on the topic. But what is important, I think,
            is that everyone now believes the parties should turn to the
          </note>
          <note>
            United Nations in search of a solution and that the
          </note>
          <note>
            Security Council should play a central role in the search for
            a solution.
          </note>
          <note>
            At the beginning when the Security Council was ignored, we all
            were worried and anxious that it had weakened the Council. If
            they now turn to the Council for a solution, and the Council helps
            bring about a solution, then what appeared to have weakened the
          </note>
          <note>
            Council may indeed have strenghtened it. It will prove to all
            concerned that sooner or later one has to turn to the Security
            Council. We hope sooner, rather than later. But that also implies
            that the Council and its members must be ready to do its duty
            in cases such as

            Fru talman! Jag uppskattar mycket att riksdagen har gjort det

          <note>
            Fru talman! Det är naturligt att dagens säkerhetspolitiska debatt
            präglas av Kosovo. Kriget i Kosovo är en tragedi. Varje dag påminns
            vi om människors lidande, flyktingar och de civila serberna. Men
            det faktum att det pågår ett krig i Europa utan att säkerhetsläget
            i Sverige påverkats visar att den svenska säkerhetspolitiken vilar
            på en stadig grund efter den positiva säkerhetspolitiska utvecklingen
            under 1990-
          </note>
          <note>
            talet.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det offensiva och framåtblickande säkerhetspolitiska samarbete
            som inletts efter det kalla krigets slut kan fullföljas. Inom
            ramen för Östersjö- och Barentssamarbetet har vi möjlighet att
            arbeta med alla de instrument som ryms i ett modernt rättssäkerhetstänkande.
          </note>
          <note>
            De säkerhetspolitiska orosmolnen efter Kosovo har bl.a. handlat
            om konsekvenserna för utvecklingen i Ryssland. Betänkandet pekar
            på att reformprocessen kommer att ta tid och på att den kan drabbas
            av bakslag. Samtidigt kan vi konstatera att det senaste årets
            allvarliga politiska kriser i Ryssland har kunnat lösas genom
            att alla politiska aktörer agerat inom ramen för den ryska författningen.
            Demokratin verkar ha fått stadigt fäste i Ryssland.
          </note>
          <note>
            För Kosovos, Europas och fredens skull är det nu viktigt att
            Ryssland deltar fullt ut i att lösa Kosovofrågan. Jag kommer senare
            i dag att ha glädjen att välkomna den ryske utrikesministern Igor
            Ivanov till
          </note>
          <note>
            Stockholm. Vi kommer också att diskutera andra samarbeten mellan
            Sverige, och EU, och Ryssland.
          </note>
          <note>
            Fru talman! Vilka lärdomar skall vi då dra av Kosovo? Den viktigaste
            lärdomen är att vi i världssamfundet måste utveckla förmågan att
            förebygga konflikter. Det har i och för sig gjorts mycket i Kosovo.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det har gällt beslut om sanktioner, resolutioner i säkerhetsrådet
            och stöd till demokratirörelser. Men det har inte gjorts tillräckligt
            mycket. Kosovo är ett tydligt exempel på att det behövs mycket
            mer av genomtänkt strategi för förebyggande.
          </note>
          <note>
            Omvärlden var inte tillräckligt tydlig när Milosevic beslutade
            om återtagande av autonomin för Kosovo och Vojvodina i mars 1989.
            Kosovo borde ha funnits med i Daytonöverenskommelsen. Självklart
            påminns vi här återigen om det klassiska dilemmat att uppmärksamheten,
            och därmed resurserna, handlingskraften och åtgärderna, har fokuserats
            på de akuta skeendena. Vi vet ju att några gram förebyggande motsvarar
            åtskilliga kilon kur efteråt. En huvuduppgift för en framåtblickande
            utrikes- och säkerhetspolitik är därför att bygga upp förebyggandets
            politiska vilja och att utveckla, vässa och förfina preventionens
            instrument.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det arbete med ett handlingsprogram för förebyggande av väpnade
            konflikter som jag anmälde för riksdagen i utrikesdeklarationen
            den 10 februari har nu avslutats i en första etapp. Jag hoppas
            att ni alla tar del av det och kommer med era synpunkter. Där
            framgår målen för vår politik för förebyggande.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det första målet är att förbättra en förebyggandets kultur och
            stärka det internationella samfundets vilja och beredskap att
            förhindra utbrott av väpnade konflikter.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det andra målet är att bättre identifiera särskilda konfliktorsaker:
            ekonomisk stagnation, ojämn resursfördelning, förtryck av mänskliga
            rättigheter och minoriteter.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det tredje målet är att stärka det internationella normsystemet
            och dess tillämpning. Det handlar om att värna och utveckla folkrätt,
            demokrati och mänskliga rättigheter. Respekt för nationell suveränitet
            får inte stå i vägen för nödvändiga insatser för att förhindra
            humanitära katastrofer eller grova kränkningar av mänskliga rättigheter.
            Folkrätten måste gälla människors och inte bara staters säkerhet.
            De som begår krigsförbrytelser måste svara för sina handlingar.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vårt fjärde mål syftar till att bättre utnyttja diplomatiska,
            politiska, ekonomiska och militära resurser för konfliktförebyggande
            insatser. Det behövs bättre metoder för kunskapsuppbyggnad, analys
            och preventiv diplomati. FN:s roll måste stärkas, och det krävs
            en tydligare arbetsfördelning mellan olika internationella organisationer.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det femte målet är att stärka den svenska kapaciteten. Det behövs
            mer av helhetssyn, och konfliktförebyggande skall tydligare integreras
            i utvecklingssamarbetet. Samverkan med folkrörelser och forskare
            skall öka.
          </note>
          <note>
            Dessa tankar är djupt förankrade i det svenska samhällets metoder
            för att utvecklas och förhindra väpnade konflikter. De blir nu
            en del av den aktiva politik som vi skall bidra med i de internationella
            sammanhang där vi verkar. Och alla dessa punkter påminner oss
            om Kosovo.
          </note>
          <note>
            Den andra viktiga lärdom vi kan dra av Kosovo är att EU måste
            stärka sin kapacitet för gemensam utrikespolitik och krishantering.
            När EU bildades i askan och ruinerna efter andra världskriget
            var EU ett fredsprojekt. Skall EU bli ett fredsprojekt för det
            tjugoförsta århundradet måste EU öppnas för hela
          </note>
          <note>
            Europa. Det gäller såväl de nuvarande kandidatländerna som Balkanländerna.
          </note>
          <note>
            EU måste stärka sin kapacitet för krishantering.
          </note>
          <note>
            Utvecklingen av gemensamma strategier och fler möjligheter till
            majoritetsbeslut ökar förutsättningarna för tidig samsyn. En gemensam
            analysenhet ger
          </note>
          <note>
            EU bättre förutsättningar att tidigt sätta in rätt åtgärder.
          </note>
          <note>
            EU:s samlade ekonomiska resurser både vad gäller handel och bistånd
            är betydande. Ett enat EU är en stark röst när den talar tydligt
            mot kränkningar av mänskliga rättigheter. Ländernas samlade resurser
            för förebyggande diplomati kan ge nya öppningar. Allt detta ger
            förutsättningar inte bara för förändringar för stunden utan också
            för möjligheterna att nå långsiktiga förändringar och förbättringar
            i Europa.
          </note>
          <note>
            Även om EU:s viktigaste utmaning är att använda de samlade resurserna
            så att militära insatser inte skall behöva komma till stånd, måste
            det också finnas en bättre beredskap för att kombinera politiska,
            diplomatiska och ekonomiska åtgärder med militär kapacitet. Sverige
            och Finland tog under den förra regeringskonferensen initiativ
            till att genom Amsterdamfördraget ge EU förmågan att agera militärt
            i krissituationer. Därför deltar vi också aktivt i diskussionerna
            inför Köln för att stärka denna förmåga. Ett viktigt exempel på
            en aktion är den minröjning som nu pågår i Kroatien under svensk
            ledning.
          </note>
          <note>
            För regeringen är det viktigt att klargöra skillnaden mellan
            krishantering och gemensamt försvar.
          </note>
          <note>
            EU:s insatser gäller fredsfrämjande arbete. Diskussionen handlar
            inte om att skapa ett gemensamt försvar. Det är också nödvändigt
            att insatserna grundas på FN-mandat eller beslut inom Organisation
            för säkerhet och samarbete i Europa, OSSE, och att alliansfria
            länder som Sverige kan delta på samma villkor som andra. Mer av
            gemensam utrikespolitik strider inte mot Sveriges militära alliansfrihet.

            Jag konstaterar, fru talman, när jag läser betänkandet och reservationerna
            att just när det gäller alliansfriheten ser vi en total splittring
            i oppositionen.
          </note>
          <note>
            Man skall komma ihåg att det är uppenbart att Sverige efterfrågas
            i Kosovo just för att vi är militärt alliansfria. Vi och andra
            alliansfria stater bidrar med fredsmäklare, och vi kommer att
            ha en viktig roll i fredsstyrkorna efter en överenskommelse och
            ett beslut i FN:s säkerhetsråd.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det är också en parallell till den roll som är uppenbar i närområdet.
            Vår säkerhetspolitiska position bidrar till säkerhet, stabilitet
            och integration. Den innebär inget hinder för ett aktivt agerande
            och gemensamt ansvarstagande på något annat område än utbyte av
            ömsesidiga försvarsförpliktelser.

            Den är ett medel, inget självändamål. Men den är ett viktigt

            stället skall vi använda oss av dem. Det gäller i närområdet,
            där alla aktörer tydligt ser värdet av vår hållning. Det gäller
            i byggandet av europeisk säkerhet, vilket Kosovo visar. Det gäller
            i arbetet med att värna och utveckla folkrätten eftersom vi har
            ett starkt eget intresse av en väl fungerande folkrätt. Det gäller
            också i kampen mot massförstörelsevapen.

            Åttanationersinitiativet för nedrustning och mot spridning av

            Men även för oss som alliansfria är samarbetet med Nato viktigt.
            Nato spelar ju i sitt samarbete med partnerländerna, bl.a. i Partnerskap
            för fred, en central roll för krishanteringen i Europa. Betänkandet
            pekar mycket riktigt på att det svenska samarbetet med Nato är
            till nytta för den samlade säkerheten.

          <note>
            Natotoppmötet nyligen konfirmerade också att Kosovo är ett undantag,
            inte en ny regel, vad gäller att agera utan FN-mandat.

          <note>
            Låt mig också peka på OSSE:s särskilda fördelar i samarbetet
            och rollfördelningen mellan de olika internationella organisationerna.
            OSSE är en alleuropeisk, öppen organisation som arbetar utifrån
            ett brett och modernt säkerhetsbegrepp. OSSE kommer därför att
            ha en central roll i förverkligandet av ett fredsavtal för Kosovo
            när det gäller demokratisering, mänskliga rättigheter och samlevnad
            mellan olika grupper.

            Den tredje viktiga lärdomen vi kan dra av Kosovo är vikten av
            att stärka och reformera FN, en fråga som vi nyss påmindes om
            när generalsekreteraren stod här. Jag vill verkligen betona den
            svenska regeringens fulla stöd för generalsekreteraren i hans
            reformprocess i FN.

            FN har i kraft av sitt stadgeenliga ansvar en central roll i
            det internationella samfundets fredsfrämjande verksamhet. FN måste
            få möjlighet att fullt ut ta det ansvaret. Därför syftar den svenska
            politiken till att vi skall undvika både en ensidig våldsanvändning
            och blockerande veton. Vi måste få en vetofri kultur i

            För att stärka FN och för att lösa Kosovo måste också Kosovofrågan
            återföras till FN:s säkerhetsråd.

          <note>
            Vårt huvudkrav för Kosovo är och förblir flyktingarnas rätt att
            i trygghet återvända till sina byar och städer. Vi vill se en
            kraftfull resolution i säkerhetsrådet som kan leda till att bombningarna
            upphör.
          </note>
          <note>
            Våldsanvändning är ju ett sista medel som bara har sitt berättigande
            när alla andra vägar uttömts. För våldsanvändning utöver självförsvar
            krävs det beslut i
          </note>
          <note>
            FN:s säkerhetsråd. Vi har därför beklagat att det inte har varit
            möjligt för världssamfundet att ställa sig bakom ett mandat i
            FN:s säkerhetsråd. Därmed har aktionen inte ett entydigt stöd
            i folkrätten.
          </note>
          <note>
            Samtidigt har vi pekat på det genuina dilemma som Kosovo visar
            på. Vi kan inte acceptera att världssamfundet står stillatigande
            inför etnisk rensning och hotande folkmord. För en varaktig lösning
            krävs det andra och mer sofistikerade metoder. Den diplomatiska
            offensiv som nu sker är nödvändig och hoppfull. Det är bråttom.
            Flyktingarna måste kunna återvända i säkerhet till hösten. Nu
            måste alla krafter samlas för att vi skall få en lösning på Kosovokrisen
            och för att vi skall stärka FN.

            Fru talman! Vi har hört FN:s generalsekreterare säga att säkerhet

          </note>
          <note>
            Europa. Det är intressant när vi just denna dag skall ta beslut
            som innebär att Sverige kanske får minskade möjligheter att bidra
            till just säkerhet och stabilitet i
          </note>
          <note>
            Europa. Det är något av ett ödets ironi att generalsekreteraren
            just denna dag skall poängtera det som borde vara uppenbart för
            alla och som borde vara vägledande när vi skall diskutera både
            säkerhetspolitiken och försvarets framtida dimension och uppgifter.
          </note>
          <note>
            Säkerhetspolitiken skall både ange det önskvärda, hur vi vill
            se att utvecklingen skall formas, och kunna gardera mot risker
            för det oönskade. Därför är det betänkande och den proposition
            som betänkandet bygger på en besvikelse. Det finns nämligen väldigt
            lite angivet om den riktning som Sverige vill se när det gäller
            säkerhetspolitiken. Däremot refereras det mycket om det som har
            skett och sker och som oftast har initierats från annat håll.
            Men i grunden är det väldigt lite som talar om hur Sverige önskar
            se säkerhetsordningen i Europa formas, hur säkerheten i Östersjöområdet
            skall formas. Vilken är Sveriges roll i det här och hur skall
            vi, om det går illa, hantera det hela? Vilken kapacitet skall
            vi ha för att kunna säkra säkerheten och stabiliteten i Europa?

            Kosovo är ett misslyckande. Det måste vi klart och tydligt poängtera.
            Det faktum att det har skett i
          </note>
          <note>
            Kosovo som vi kunde förutse skulle kunna ske och som vi har debatterat
            i denna riksdag och på många andra håll - likväl har det alltså
            skett - är ett misslyckande som också är Sveriges misslyckande.
            Vi bär vår del av detta misslyckande därför att vi inte har mekanismer
            som kraftfullt nog kan förebygga.
          </note>
          <note>
            Den alldeles centrala slutsatsen av Kosovo är väl att vi inte
            kan nöja oss med det säkerhetsarbete som vi hittills har bedrivit,
            utan vi måste se till att det ytterligare intensifieras.

            Vad är då Sveriges bidrag till detta? Ja, det första som man
            blir förvånad över är diskussionen om neutralitet. Om man nu skall
            bygga en säkerhetsordning i
          </note>
          <note>
            Europa, kan den då bygga på idén om neutralitet?

          <note>
            Skall länderna stå neutrala i förhållande till varandra?
          </note>
          <note>
            Är det så man bygger en stark och fin säkerhetsordning i Europa,
            dvs. att neutraliteten bygger på att man står likgiltig inför
            det som händer? Är det fråga om neutralitet i närområdet står
            man likgiltig inför vad som händer grannarna.
          </note>

            Om vi nu skall bygga en stark säkerhetsordning i
          </note>
          <note>
            Europa skall Sveriges bidrag till detta vara att vi skall kunna
            vara neutrala - att vi skall kunna stå likgiltiga och inte behöva
            bry oss. Men det är en alldeles orimlig hållning att det, om man
            skall bygga en europeisk säkerhetsordning, skall finnas begrepp
            som neutralitet i detta. Själva grundidén är ju att ha ett gemensamt
            ansvar för de delade värderingar som generalsekreteraren talade
            om. Då måste vi alla ta ett gemensamt ansvar. Det är raka motsatsen
            till neutralitet. Det innebär att man försvarar de gemensamma
            värderingarna. Det innebär att man känner ett ansvar för folkrätten,
            att man engagerar sig i brott mot folkrätten.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det gör Sverige; det har vi gjort i Kuwait och det gör vi i Kosovo.
            Vi står ju inte likgiltiga eller neutrala när det gäller Kosovo,
            utan vi har engagerat oss.
          </note>
          <note>
            Men om det sker brott mot folkrätten i närområdet skall vi då
            stå likgiltiga? Är det då som vi inte längre skall bry oss? Vi
            kan visserligen försvara folkrätten när den ligger en bit bort
            men bryts folkrätten i vårt närområde skall vi kunna stå likgiltiga.
            Det är faktiskt vad som står i betänkandet och det är faktiskt
            det som riksdagen, om betänkandet antas, säger.

            Det är den signal vi skickar till våra nära grannländer - till

            Ni skall veta att om det riktigt gäller har Sverige reserverat
            sig rätten att stå likgiltigt. Vi kan samarbeta mer intimt. Vi
            kan samarbeta oerhört nära. Men om det riktigt gäller -

          <note>
            om ni blir utsatta för ett övergrepp, ett gravt brott mot folkrätten,

            Statsministern fick i en tidning en fråga om hans syn om en EU-medlem
            skulle angripas. Statsministern svarade att han inte ens hade
            reflekterat över frågan. Då ställer man sig lite undrande. Är
            det detta att statsministern och kanske regeringen i övrigt inte
            ens har reflekterat över frågan som ligger bakom formuleringen?
            Man vill ju inte tro att det är sant. Det skulle vara intressant
            att höra om någon annan i regeringen har reflekterat över frågan
            om Sverige, om ett nordiskt grannland eller en EU-medlem angrips,
            då skall stå likgiltigt.

            När det gäller att bygga säkerheten i Östersjöområdet var Sverige
            mycket starkt och pådrivande fram till augusti 1994. Det var ju

          <note>
            Nato. Vi har nu en politik inom Nato som är den öppna dörrens
            politik som innebär att Nato står öppet för de länder i Europa
            som önskar gå med och som kan uppfylla villkoren för medlemskap.

            Detta innebär att Östersjöns sydkust i dag helt och hållet är

            Dessa fundamentala förändringar i förändringsprocessen vore det
            också intressant om Sverige hade en synpunkt på men det finns
            ingen synpunkt. Det finns ett iakttagande av vad som sker. Men
            om Sverige tycker att det är bra eller dåligt framgår inte av
            majoritetens betänkande.

          <note>
            Vi kan från Sveriges sida inte ens säga att det är bra att Polen
            har blivit medlem i Nato. Vi kan inte ens säga att vi tycker att
            det är bra att Estland, Lettland och Litauen ansöker om medlemskap
            och att vi hoppas att de snarast möjligt skall komma med.

            Det måste ju rimligtvis ändå vara så att Sveriges hållning i
            närområdet är att vi skall vara tillsammans med våra nordiska
            grannländer, med våra grannländer på andra sidan Östersjön. Vi
            skall inte stå vid sidan av utan fullt ut delta i den säkerhetsordning
            som byggs upp. Vi vet i dag inte riktigt hur det kommer att sluta.
            Vi sitter inte med facit i hand. Men Sveriges bidrag måste ju
            vara att säga att vi skall delta, driva på och fullt ut vara med
            tillsammans med våra nordiska och våra baltiska grannar. Vi skall
            inte stå vid sidan av.

            man skall fullt ut respektera de spelregler som vi har satt upp
            i Europa. Det är viktigt att vi är tydliga på den punkten. Ryssland
            är också välkommet tillsammans med sina trygga grannländer. Rysslands
            grannländer skall känna sig trygga i en situation där också

            Ryssland finns med i samarbetet. Det är här, naturligtvis, som
            Nato är så avgörande. Natos kanske viktigaste roll i Europa är
            att se till att vi säkert och tryggt kan integrera Ryssland i
            samarbetet.

            Det är oerhört viktigt att inse att de här mekanismerna måste
            finnas. Vad skedde efter andra världskriget? Jo, man förmådde
            integrera Tyskland, ett land som då naturligtvis var föraktat
            av sina grannländer.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det hade funnits koncentrationsläger, Gestapo hade gått på gatorna.
            Men man förmådde integrera Tyskland i samarbetet därför att man
            byggde fasta strukturer som höll i samarbetet, ett fast förpliktande
            samarbete.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det är naturligtvis i grunden samma sak som måste ske med Ryssland.
            Vi måste ha starka samarbetsstrukturer som gör det möjligt att
            integrera Ryssland i samarbetet, och vi måste vara tydliga gentemot
          </note>
          <note>
            Ryssland. I mitten av 1990-talet fick vi mycket kritik för att
            vi inte hade varit tydliga nog när det gällde
          </note>
          <note>
            Rysslands beteende i Tjetjenien, eller Rysslands regerings beteende
            kanske vi skall säga. Tjetjenien är ju faktiskt en del av Ryssland.
            Vi hade en tendens att vara för svaga, att inte tydligt nog markera
            de värderingar som vi står för. Därför måste Rysslandspolitiken
            vara tydlig. Vi skall tydligt ange det vi kräver.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det är också viktigt därför att den interna utvecklingen i Ryssland
            påverkas av Europas hållning i övrigt.

            Det är inte så att andra har ett ansvar och att vi kan titta
            på. Misslyckandet är, som jag sade tidigare, också vårt misslyckande.
            Det är Sveriges regerings misslyckande, och i viss mån naturligtvis
            också Sveriges riksdags misslyckande, att det som sker i Kosovo
            kan ske.

            För att vi skall ha möjlighet att återställa någon form av fred
            i Kosovo så att man kan flytta tillbaka kommer det att krävas
            resurser. Det kommer att krävas resurser på många olika håll.
            Men här och nu är det viktigaste att fokusera på de militära resurser
            som kommer att behövas. Förmodligen kommer det att behövas trupp
            inte bara i Kosovo utan kanske även i
          </note>
          <note>
            Makedonien, Albanien och Montenegro. Vi kommer kanske sammantaget
            att på Balkan eller västra Balkan behöva ha 100 000-150 000 personer
            i olika former av fredsbevarande - förhoppningsvis finns det en
            fred att bevara - eller fredsframtvingande insatser.

            Klarar vi då detta? Här har vi ett stort bekymmer.

          <note>
            Vi i Europa talar mycket om mekanismer och om vikten av att göra
            det här. Samtidigt har Sverige, och för övrigt också andra länder,
            dragit ned på sina resurser. Man har svårt att klara det här.
            Europa är i dag mer beroende av USA kapacitetsmässigt än vad man
            var i början av 1990-talet. Parallellt med retoriken om vilket
            ansvar vi har, om hur viktigt det är att vi tar ansvar, urgröper
            vi vår möjlighet att fullt ut göra detta. Vi har inte den förmågan.
            Oavsett hur många mekanismer vi bygger upp och vad det står i
            våra fördrag måste det finnas både kapacitet och en förmåga att
            komma samman och fylla fördragen med innehåll. Kan vi inte enas
            blir det i alla fall ingenting av, hur eleganta fördragen än är
            formulerade.

            Här har vi tyvärr en klyfta mellan ord och handling som vi nästan
            är på väg att se vidgas. Besluten om försvarets kapacitet i Sverige
            kommer att bidra till att klyftan mellan ord och handling vidgas.
            Risken är stor att vi får ett försvar som inte har kapacitet att
            fullfölja det vi behöver på hemmaplan, de insatser vi behöver
            göra för den europeiska säkerheten och de förpliktelser som vi
            fortfarande har mot FN-systemet i övrigt. De har ju inte försvunnit
            utan finns kvar. Det är, tycker jag, viktigt i dag när generalsekreteraren
            har varit här att betona detta.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vi vet att det finns kritik inom FN för att Sverige har dragit
            ned på ambitionerna vad gäller våra styrkor i FN-sammanhang. Det
            fick man minsann höra när man var i FN och FN:s generalförsamling.

          <note>
            Nu är vi i en situation där jag tror att vi får svårt att klara
            de kanske över 2 000 personer som vi behöver ha - män och kvinnor
            som kan behövas för fredsbevarande insatser på Balkan. Risken
            är alltså att vi här tar ett beslut som gör att vi de facto går
            emot de vackra formuleringarna. Vi ökar klyftan mellan ord och
            handling.

            Slutligen fru talman, bara ett ord om en annan sak som är viktig
            och som står i det här betänkandet. Det gäller frågan om vapenexport.
            Skall vi ha en egen industri i Sverige som i allt väsentligt skall
            kunna tillgodose våra egna behov, som skall kunna överleva som
            egen industri och inte bli beroende av import utifrån och framför
            allt kanske import från USA, är det nu tid att vi inom Europa
            utformar gemensamma regler för vapenexporten. Och det är bråttom.
            Risken är annars att vi inte har så mycket av egen vapenindustri
            att slå vakt om.

            Fru talman! Vänsterpartiet delar i stort de överväganden som
            görs i betänkandet Sveriges säkerhetspolitik. Men det finns nyansskillnader
            och i en del fall meningsmotsättningar. Framför allt kanske de
            handlar om det som inte står i betänkandet och som är mest aktuellt
            just nu, nämligen Sveriges agerande i samband med krisen och kriget

          <note>
            Den politiken handlar inte enbart om att Sverige skall stå utanför
            medlemskretsen bland de militära allianserna. Det handlar också
            om att vara en stark försvarare för små nationers rättigheter
            och en tillskyndare av folkrätten. Det handlar inte alls om att
            vara neutral i konflikter, men det handlar om att ha ett annat
            synsätt än det som bygger på ömsesidig säkerhetspolitik mellan
            stater mot yttre fiender.

            Sverige har traditionellt verkat för internationell nedrustning,
            kärnvapenkontroll och fredlig krishantering. Vi har förespråkat
            civila, diplomatiska och politiska lösningar i stället för militära.
            Vi har aldrig förnekat att det ibland kan vara nödvändigt med
            militärt våld för att möta ett värre övervåld, men frågan är:
            Vem skall ha rätten att bestämma när det är nödvändigt och när
            det är rimligt?
          </note>
          <note>
            Om USA får ta sig rätten att bestämma, om Nato skall vara den
            organisation som beslutar om militärt våld i internationella kriser,
            kommer då någonsin våra bedömningar av förtryck, etnisk rensning
            och folkfördrivning att vara de som ligger till grund för ingripanden?
            Kommer t.ex. någonsin Turkiet att ha något att frukta av militär
            våldsanvändning för att ingripa mot det systematiska förtrycket

            kort tid, ingrep inte Nato. Det var inte heller dess hemisfär,
            inte dess roll att ingripa i en liknande konflikt, men i Europa
            ser man sig som den naturliga försvararen av sina egna legitima
            intressen, och det väger tyngre än FN-systemets roll eller internationell
            lag.

            misslyckande. Jag vill då bara påpeka att Vänsterpartiet 1993
            föreslog att alla flyktingar som hade kommit från Kosovo till
            Sverige skulle ges permanent uppehållstillstånd. Vi föreslog att
            den process av återvändande som då fanns skulle avbrytas, och
            vi gjorde det med anledning av de grova kränkningar av mänskliga
            rättigheter som förekom från de serbiska och jugoslaviska myndigheternas

          <note>
            Förbundsrepubliken Jugoslavien. Detta försvårade på ett mycket

            att söka asyl i
          </note>

            Milosevicregimen om återvändande för kosovoalbanska flyktingar.
            Den officiella svenska inställningen har alltför tydligt varit
            att problemen i Kosovo inte har varit så allvarliga att vi inte
            skulle verka för att flyktingar skulle återvända. Förtrycket har
            tydligen inte varit så allvarligt att vi har haft anledning att
            oreserverat ge asyl till människor som flytt från området.

            och till att
          </note>
          <note>
            FN har ställts åt sidan. Vi har i dag en osäkrare värld än vi
            hade innan kriget bröt ut. Den etniskt grundade folkfördrivningen
            har accelererat, den jugoslaviska oppositionen har närmast utraderats,
            och det finns spridningsrisker i regionen. T.ex. menar flera bedömare
            att situationen i Bosnien nu blir allt allvarligare.

            Naturligtvis finns det ett samband med Sveriges säkerhetspolitiska
            läge om vi accepterar eller uttrycker förståelse för en världsordning
            där en militärallians eller en supermakt ges bestämmanderätten
            om internationell användning av militärt våld. Då har också
          </note>

            Sveriges säkerhetspolitik i grunden förändrats.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det finns också en oroväckande tendens i Sveriges säkerhetspolitik
            som handlar om en sorts anpassning till en gemensam politik, där
            VEU och Nato spelar en stor roll. Å ena sidan finns det här i
            Sveriges riksdag, vilket vi nyss har hört, moderaternas förtal
            av alliansfriheten, deras nidbild av neutraliteten. Å andra sidan
            finns vårt och andras starka försvar av alliansfriheten och neutraliteten.
            Men lite mittemellan finns regeringens vackra tal om alliansfrihet,
            som paras med ett starkt närmande till det västliga och euroatlantiska
            militära samarbetet.
          </note>
          <note>
            Argumenten för alliansfriheten försvagas naturligtvis när Sverige
            knyter sig allt närmare till Nato, till den västeuropeiska unionen
            och till den gemensamma utrikes- och säkerhetspolitiken inom EU.

            är i stället det traditionella svenska, att fredsskapande, fredsbevarande
            och fredsframtvingande åtgärder skall genomföras på OSSE:s eller
            FN:s uppdrag och under dessa organisationers ledning och att de
            åtgärder som nu vidtas för att öka genomskinligheten och förtroendet
            mellan stater skall ske i ett alleuropeiskt eller ett världsvitt
            samarbete.
          </note>
          <note>
            OSSE:s mandat bör utökas, och vi bör arbeta för att mer resurser

            Det är också så att EU är på väg att utvecklas i en riktning
            som leder till ett direkt militärt samarbete som i värsta fall
            kan leda till en gemensam försvarspolitik. Den nye ordföranden
            för EG-kommissionen,
          </note>
          <note>
            Romano Prodi, har helt klart en vision av ett Europas förenta
            stater med ett gemensamt försvar. Det är av avgörande betydelse
            för den svenska alliansfrihetens upprätthållande att försvars-
            och säkerhetspolitikens grunddrag bestäms på nationell nivå.

            Fru talman! I det europeiska försvarssamarbetet ingår också ett
            försvarsindustrisamarbete. I det här samarbetet ser vi stora risker.
            En av riskerna är naturligtvis att Sverige med sin relativt restriktiva
            hållning till vapenexport och krigsmaterielexport därvidlag kommer
            att tvingas till en harmonisering med länder som har väsentligt
            mer liberala regler.
          </note>
          <note>
            Därför är det viktigt för oss att yrka bifall till reservation
            nr 13, som just handlar om att svensk vapenexport måste ha minst
            samma restriktiva regler i fortsättningen som i dagsläget och
            att det är ett villkor för ett svenskt deltagande i ett utvidgat
            europeiskt försvarsindustrisamarbete. Annars kommer Sverige att
            i större utsträckning ta på sig rollen som vapenmånglaren och
            spridaren av osäkerhet genom en mer liberal vapenexport.

            Den säkerhetspolitiska utvecklingen är svårförutsägbar, inte

            kan inte utesluta risken för en storkonflikt på Balkan, något

            stor behövs en noggrann säkerhetspolitisk analys innan försvarets
            grund- och krigsorganisation slutgiltigt fastställs.

            Fru talman! Ett bibehållande av Sveriges militära alliansfrihet
            ställer krav på en betryggande försvarsförmåga. Vi kristdemokrater
            motsätter oss därför de stora nedskärningar i försvarsbudgeten
            som görs utifrån osäkra antaganden. Försvarsmaktens ekonomi har
            redan innan nedskärningarna utsatts för enorma påfrestningar och
            instabila regler. Konsekvensen blir att Försvarsmakten inte får
            den långsiktiga styrka som vi kristdemokrater anser behövs. Det
            innebär också att trovärdigheten för viljan att utforma ett nytt
            försvar urholkas.

            För att Sverige inte skall hamna i ett sämre säkerhetspolitiskt
            läge när det europeiska säkerhetsmönstret förändras, är det viktigt
            att vi är med i de olika forum som finns för att kunna påverka
            utvecklingen och därigenom tydliggöra vår vilja att ta aktivt
            ansvar för Europas säkerhet. Vårt medlemskap i EU, vårt samarbete
            med Nato i SFOR och PFF och observatörskapet i VEU har ökat förutsättningarna
            för en aktiv säkerhetspolitik. Därigenom har Sverige en historisk
            möjlighet att delta i arbetet med att skapa ett enat

            Sverige bör vara öppet för medlemskap i alla de säkerhetsorganisationer
            som finns i Europa. Svensk säkerhetspolitik skall inte låsas fast
            vid en linje i den nya och svårförutsägbara situation som råder.
            Om vi i framtiden skulle ställas inför hot om väpnat angrepp,
            måste vi vara beredda att ta konsekvenserna av den djupa samverkan
            som vi har med de fredsbevarande krafterna i Europa så att vi
            är med när besluten fattas.

            Nato har blivit en naturlig del av svensk säkerhetspolitik. Nato
            är en viktig del av Europas framväxande säkerhetsarkitektur och
            bidrar till stabilitet och säkerhet. En utveckling där Litauen,
            Lettland, Estland och kanske Finland blir Natomedlemmar är inte
            bara önskvärd utan också sannolik. Sverige kan inte stå likgiltigt
            inför en utveckling som säkrar de baltiska ländernas frihet och
            självständighet. Eftersom vi själva värdesätter frihet och demokrati,
            bör vi också vara beredda att försvara de principer om frihet,
            demokrati och mänskliga rättigheter som utgör själva grunden för
            ett fredligt Europa.

            Svenskt medlemskap i Nato är för närvarande inte aktuellt, men

          </note>
          <note>
            Ungern och Tjeckien samt PFF-samarbetet gör att vi måste vara

            EU är av fundamental betydelse för säkerhet och stabilitet i
            Europa, och Sveriges medlemskap ger ökade möjligheter att verka
            för ett Europa präglat av öppenhet, demokrati och gemensam säkerhet.
            Sverige har ett intresse av att de hot, risker och påfrestningar
            som ryms inom det vidgade säkerhetsbegreppet kan hanteras gemensamt
            med andra länder i vårt närområde samt inom EU. Även om EU saknar
            förpliktelser om rent militär hjälp, är det självklart att medlemsländerna
            inte kan stå likgiltiga om något annat medlemsland utsätts för
            våld eller hot om våld. Det innebär att vårt medlemskap i EU i
            sig utgör en säkerhetspolitisk nettofördel.
          </note>
          <note>
            Säkerheten i Sveriges närområde spelar en central roll i utformningen
            av vår säkerhetspolitik. Österut kvarstår en politisk osäkerhet
            och därmed ett hot mot säkerheten. Genom ett starkt samarbete
            med våra grannländer i Östersjöregionen kan vi bidra till att
            förbättra hotbilden och förebygga konflikter. De baltiska ländernas
            försvarsförmåga kan stärkas och utvecklas genom fortsatt stöd
            till deras uppbyggnad av totalförsvar och andra säkerhetsfunktioner.
            De bör även stödjas i strävan att bli medlemmar i EU, vilket är
            ett viktigt säkerhetspolitiskt intresse för Sverige.

            Fru talman! Avslutningsvis vill jag än en gång understryka det
            som vi kristdemokrater ofta har sagt om vikten av att så tidigt
            som möjligt ingripa för att genom föregripande diplomati och åtgärder
            kunna avvärja eller släcka eldfängda situationer som annars kan
            flamma upp till bränder som kan vara ett hot, inte bara för sitt
            eget område.

            FN:s generalsekreterare här, är det klart att man funderar över
            FN:s roll i framtiden. Jag noterade att utrikesministern i sitt
            anförande formulerade sig ungefär så här när det gällde FN: Det
            gäller att stärka och reformera FN. Det måste införas en vetofri

            Jag vill understryka detta. Det är viktigt att vi diskuterar
            en FN-reform för 2000-talet. Utrikesministern och jag hade ju
            en debatt häromdagen på just det temat, att gå in och se om man
            kan göra några förändringar i stadgarna för att genomföra denna
            vetofria kultur som utrikesministern talar om.

            Europas stater har dock inte kunnat förhindra de katastrofer
            Restjugoslavien i dag genomlider. Det är naturligt att vi en dag
            som denna, när vi talar om europeisk säkerhetspolitik, också uppehåller
            oss vid situationen i Kosovo. Jag skall återkomma till det lite
            senare.

            Med den tragiska utvecklingen i Bosnien och Kosovo och mot bakgrund
            av de uppenbara bristerna i samarbetet inom FN och EU kom det
            militära samarbetet inom Nato att framstå som ett viktigt inslag
            i den alleuropeiska säkerhetsstrukturen. Nato har förändrats från
            det kalla krigets försvarsallians till det militära verktyget
            i en alleuropeisk konflikthantering.
          </note>
          <note>
            Denna utveckling har förstärkts genom den välkomna framväxten
            av samarbete inom ramen för Partnerskap för fred, i vilket de
            flesta europeiska stater deltar, genom Natos särskilda samarbete
            med Ryssland samt genom att EU och Nato påbörjat en utvidgningsprocess
            för de nya demokratierna i Öst- och Centraleuropa. När Polen,
            Tjeckien och Ungern nu blivit medlemmar av Nato och medlemsskaran

            En förutsättning för en stats medlemskap i Nato är en stabil

            eller externa konflikter löses på fredlig väg. Sett i ett historiskt

            Sommaren 1995, efter det att 40 000 bosnier fördrivits från staden
            Srebrenica som FN förklarat för fredad zon och 7 000 massakrerats,
            krävde Folkpartiet via sin partiledare att Sverige i FN skulle
            verka för ett mer kraftfullt försvar för de fredade zonerna med
            hjälp av FN. Det avvisades av Vänsterpartiet och dess ledare Gudrun
            Schyman, som menade att FN inte skulle verka militärt. Säkerhetsrådet
            var då inte förlamat av Rysslands och Kinas veton, som det är
            i dag.

          <note>
            Det visades bl.a. under hösten när Nato fick i uppdrag att flygbomba
            det bosnienserbiska artilleriet.

            Efter frågor här i kammaren sedan kriget i Bosnien upphört efter
            Natos flygbombningar vid det tillfället medgav Vänsterpartiets
            företrädare att det, givet den situation som förelåg i Bosnien,
            trots allt var bra att Natos bombningar kunde få slut på tre och
            ett halvt års krig. Det visar på Vänsterpartiets dilemma även
            i dag, när man så kraftfullt fördömer bombningarna i Kosovo. Då
            fördömde man att FN skulle gå in vid det tillfället. Nu fördömer
            man att Nato skall gå in.

            Hur menar Vänsterpartiet att vi skulle få ett stopp på det som
            nu sker i Kosovo och det som har skett i form av förföljelser
            av kosovoalbaner? Tidigare skulle vi inte använda oss av FN. FN
            skulle förhindras använda sådana maktmedel. Nu säger Vänsterpartiet
            nej också till Nato. På något sätt måste man få stopp på den rensning

            Karl-Göran Biörsmark frågade vilka alternativ vi ser till den
            konflikthantering som Nato står för. För det första menar vi att
            den enda legitima organisation som har rätten att ingripa i mellanstatliga
            och inomstatliga konflikter är Förenta nationerna. Det kan ske
            genom andra organisationer, om det sker på uppdrag av FN, av ett
            legitimt internationellt rättssystem. För det andra menar Vänsterpartiet
            att den process med fredsförhandlingar som pågått, som bl.a. ledde
            till ett förslag till avtal i Rambouillet, hade det uppenbara
            syftet att inte få någon lösning till stånd. Den fredsprocessen
            var egentligen ett sätt att försöka tvinga den jugoslaviska regeringen
            att gå med på en
          </note>
          <note>
            Natoinsats på eget territorium.

          <note>
            Det är svårt att se att Sverige eller något annat land skulle
            kunna gå med på en liknande överenskommelse i en liknande situation.
            Därmed hade Nato, utan att ha någon som helst plan för handlandet
            efter ett fredsavtal, satt sig i en sits där man för att rädda
            sitt eget anseende var tvungen att börja bomba. Det har fått de
            resultat vi ser - ökade civila offer, ökad folkfördrivning, ökad
            osäkerhet med Ryssland ställt åt sidan och FN-systemet kastat
            bakom ryggen. Det är ett uselt sätt att bekämpa konflikter, etniska
            problem och etnisk rensning i vår omvärld. Det leder bara till
            större problem.

            Milosevic. Ryssland och Kina har stoppat FN:s möjlighet att agera.
            Vad återstår då? Det är frågan till

            Vad återstår i en sådan situation? Man kan säga att det som återstår
            är att Milosevic får fortsätta. Det kan man tänka sig. Men vi
            har hört i dag att det internationella samfundet inte bara kan
            stå och titta på när det blir konflikter inom länder. Även om
            FN-stadgan är oklar på den punkten, om FN över huvud taget får
            agera inom länder, kan resten av världen gärna inte stå och titta
            på.

            Lars Ohly och Vänsterpartiet har inte svar på min fråga. Därför
            säger vi från Folkpartiets sida att det som sker nu var nödvändigt,
            även om vi naturligtvis också skulle ha velat att man kom fram
            till någonting annat i Rambouillet. Men det gjorde man inte. Förföljelserna
            och massakrerandet av kosovoalbaner har fortsatt. Vad är vänsterns
            och Lars Ohlys svar?

            Fru talman! År efter år har vi kunnat se förtrycket av kosovoalbaner.
            Då borde det rimligtvis inte vara ett bra förhållningssätt att
            införa visumtvång för människor som vill fly från det förtrycket.
            Folkpartiet var ansvarigt för det i den borgerliga regeringen.

          <note>
            Birgit Friggebo drev igenom det 1993. Det är Folkpartiets ansvar
            att färre människor har kunnat fly från det förtryck och den etniska
            rensning som har pågått i
          </note>

            Kosovo.
          </note>
          <note>
            Konflikthanteringen har lett till att Nato har tagit sig rätten
            att vara världspolis. Det sker med Folkpartiets fulla godkännande.
            Det är inte förvånande. Folkpartiet och dess ledare Lars Leijonborg
            har sagt att partiet är inte bara det mest EU-vänliga partiet
            i Sverige utan också det mest Amerikavänliga partiet. När det
            regnar i Washington spänner K-G Biörsmark upp paraplyet i Stockholm.
            Så USA-vänligt är Folkpartiet numera! Då ställer man också upp
            på en konflikthantering som leder till ett utdraget krig, mycket
            stora problem och svårigheter för civilbefolkningen, både den
            kosovoalbanska och den jugoslaviska.

            Fru talman! Ärade ledamöter! Protokolläsare! Vi diskuterar här
            den svenska säkerhetspolitiken, mot bakgrund av de omvälvande
            omvärldsförändringar som vi har upplevt de senaste tio åren. Det
            vi kanske känner bäst till är det som har hänt i vårt eget närområde
            - upplösningen av Warszawapakten, Sovjetunionens kollaps och de
            drastiskt minskade militärutgifterna i Europa. Militärutgifterna
            har minskat med i genomsnitt 50 %. Det får konsekvenser inte minst
            för utformningen av den svenska försvarspolitiken, något som vi
            kommer att diskutera lite senare här i dag.
          </note>
          <note>
            Omvärldsförändringar har också skett på ett annat plan. För tio
            år sedan var krigen i världen mellanstatliga. I dag finns bara
            ett enda mellanstatligt krig kvar.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det är kriget mellan Indien och Pakistan. I stället upplever
            vi nu en situation med en lång rad lokala och regionala konflikter
            och inbördeskrig. Just den förändringen innebär att FN har fått
            en ny roll. Diskussionen understryks av att FN:s generalsekreterare
          </note>
          <note>
            Kofi Annan har inlett förmiddagens diskussioner.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det är viktigt att vi bidrar till att utveckla FN bort från rollen
            som städgumma, som alltid kommer för sent - när svältkatastrofen
            är ett faktum, när krigen har pågått, när folkmorden genomförs.
            FN måste i stället bli en offensiv, aktiv organisation som förebygger
            och föregriper svältkatastrofer, väpnade konflikter, folkfördrivning,
            folkmord och krig.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det är det internationella samfundets underlåtenhet att göra
            detta som vi nu ser konsekvenserna av i vår egen världsdel: det
            som sker i det forna Jugoslavien och den nationalistiska regimen
            Milosevics folkfördrivningspolitik, som är fullständigt oacceptabel.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det är oacceptabelt att en stat kan använda sin suveränitet som
            täckmantel för olika former av förtryck och, i detta fall, folkfördrivningspolitik.
            Folkmord och folkfördrivning kan aldrig, och får aldrig, bli en
            stats inre angelägenhet. När människor i Kosovo mördas, när kvinnor
            våldtas, när barn tvingas ut på vägarna på flykt ifrån terror
            och ifrån den jugoslaviska regimens militära styrkor är det också
            min angelägenhet. Det är också vår gemensamma angelägenhet.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det är inte Milosevics och det forna Jugoslaviens inre angelägenhet.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det internationella världssamfundet skall blanda sig i hur enskilda
            regimer agerar även inom sitt eget land när man bedriver folkfördrivning
            och när man utövar folkmord. Världssamfundet måste också vara
            berett att genomföra kraftfulla interventioner i första hand med
            civila insatser, men vi kan inte utesluta militära inslag för
            att skydda livsmedelstransporter, för att skydda civilbefolkning
            och för att skydda olika former av humanitära insatser.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vi ser väldigt tydligt att det främsta hindret för att kunna
            göra detta från FN:s sida har varit vetot. Det var därför intressant
            att höra hur vår utrikesminister här för en halvtimme sedan talade
            om en vetofri kultur. Det är en nödvändig utveckling av FN, om
            vi skall kunna se en aktiv och offensiv förebyggande och föregripande
            organisation. Vi måste vara beredda att diskutera säkerhetsrådets
            framtid. Man måste kanske snarare bygga på konsensus minus ett
            eller konsensus minus två om rådet skall kunna bli en kraftfull
            aktör och kunna förebygga de katastrofer som vi inte vill se.
          </note>
          <note>
            Om vi misslyckas med detta - om vi misslyckas med att införa
            en vetofri kultur och misslyckas med att utforma någon form av
            konsensus minus ett - ser vi alla vad som händer. Vi har sett
            det de senaste månaderna i vår egen världsdel. Vi riskerar att
            enskilda stater eller militärallianser agerar på eget bevåg, som
            i detta fall Nato, med flera olika negativa konsekvenser som följd.
            I Natos fall i Europa bryter man t.ex. mot den internationella
            rätten, och det kan utgöra ett farligt prejudikat. Andra stater
            och andra militärallianser kan ta sig samma rätt i andra delar
            av världen, och det är en farlig utveckling.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vi ser också negativa konsekvenser på det sättet att flygattackerna
            mot det forna Jugoslavien - mot
          </note>
          <note>
            Serbien - inte leder till att man når de mål som man har uppsatt,
            utan kanske t.o.m. snarare till motsatsen.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det är viktigt, tror jag, att rikta kritik mot Nato, men det
            är oerhört viktigt att rikta kritik mot Milosevic och den nationalistiska
            regimen och den politik regimen för. Det är kanske allra viktigast
            att rikta kritik mot de brister vi ser i FN-systemet, som har
            lett till den situation vi nu upplever.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det är viktigt att dessa omvärldsförändringar också får konsekvenser
            för hur Sveriges säkerhetspolitik utformas i ett mer internationellt
            perspektiv på det mer utrikespolitiska planet, och att vi diskuterar
            Sveriges roll när det gäller FN:s framtid. Det var väl lite av
            Kofi Annans budskap här; FN blir inte mer än vad de olika nationella
            medlemsstaterna gör det till. Vi implementerar de beslut som man
            fattar i FN.
          </note>
          <note>
            På samma sätt som jag tror att det är viktigt att vi ser en utveckling
            bort ifrån det nationella invasionsförsvaret, där vi har haft
            tyngdpunkten i svensk säkerhetspolitik de senaste decennierna
            under efterkrigstiden, tror jag att det är viktigt att se vilken
            politik vi skall föra för att kunna stärka FN och, kanske viktigast
            av allt, inte motverka de förändringar av FN
          </note>
          <note>
            som vi vill se. Jag vill därför peka på tre av de förslag som
            Miljöpartiet har haft i sin motion, fru talman.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det första är behovet av fler civila insatsenheter.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vid upprättandet av den höge representantens organisation i Bosnien-Hercegovina
            1995, och senast nu vid upprättandet av OSSE:s verifikationsmission
            i Kosovo, saknades insatsberedd ledningsfunktion där en lång rad
            olika kompetenser som poliser, biståndsexperter, militärer och
            inte minst ledningsresurser hade varit till stor nytta redan från
            start. Just exemplet
          </note>
          <note>
            OSSE:s verifikationsmission tycker jag är ett talande exempel
            på en situation där det internationella samfundet brast. Vi hade
            fortfarande möjlighet att förhindra det som nu sker i Kosovo.
            OSSE beslutar sig för att föra in 2 000 civila observatörer i
            Kosovo för att förhindra övergreppen och kunna beivra och samla
            bevis för övergreppen mot civilbefolkningen från den serbiska
            regimens styrkor. Vi lyckades efter flera veckor inte få ihop
            mer än 1 300 personer - långt ifrån tillräckligt - och Sveriges
            bidrag var 74 personer. 74 av 2 000!
          </note>
          <note>
            Jag tycker att det är belysande att ställa det i kontrast till
            vad man nu diskuterar, för nu finns det plötsligt resurser att
            sätta upp militära styrkor motsvarande
          </note>
          <note>
            50 000 man i området, med dyrbar militär utrustning.
          </note>
          <note>
            Sveriges regering diskuterar att ställa en väpnad styrka på 500
            man till FN:s förfogande. Nu finns plötsligt resurserna.
          </note>
          <note>
            Jag tror att det väldigt tydligt sätter i blixtbelysning vår
            gamla traditionella beredskap att kunna rycka in i efterhand militärt
            i det internationella samfundet. Det belyser just bristen på civila,
            förebyggande och föregripande insatser. Därför är det viktigt
            att vi ökar Sveriges förberedelser och beredskap att kunna ställa
            civila insatsenheter till FN:s förfogande som ett viktigt led
            i att skapa en förebyggande och föregripande offensiv organisation.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det andra förslaget rör minröjningsinsatser. Flera motioner som
            gäller Sveriges bidrag till minröjning har behandlats. Vi känner
            alla väl till den fruktansvärda situation som många hundra miljoner
            människor lever i. Över hundra miljoner landminor finns utspridda
            i olika länder. Trots att krigen slutat för många år sedan ligger
            de kvar och skördar dödsoffer varje dag. Tusentals människor slits
            varje år sönder.
          </note>
          <note>
            Detta skapar enorma problem för stater som försöker bygga upp
            sig själva efter krig.
          </note>
          <note>
            Här har Sverige en unik kompetens. Vi förfogar förmodligen över
            den mest moderna minröjningsmekaniken, framtagen av Bofors. Andra
            företag har bidragit med nya produkter, som ökar hastigheten med
            vilken man kan se om ett fält är minerat eller inte. Sverige skulle
            kunna bidra långt mer.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det sägs förvisso att minröjning skall vara en prioriterad del
            av försvarets internationella verksamhet, och vi hör ofta hur
            vår försvarsminister och utrikesminister talar för att Sverige
            gör väldigt mycket. Det är sant. Vi gör väldigt mycket. Men i
            relation till vad vi förmår, och i relation till de enorma behoven,
            skulle Sverige kunna göra bra mycket mer. Tittar vi på budgeten
            ser vi att talet om att detta skulle vara en prioriterad verksamhet
            motsvaras av ynka 2 %. Det har jag svårt att få att gå ihop med
            att detta är en prioriterad verksamhet, när man i praktiken bara
            satsar mindre än 2 % av försvarsbudgeten på detta område.
          </note>
          <note>
            Slutligen vill jag ta upp vapenexportfrågan. Jag tror att kriget
            i det forna Jugoslavien har satt blixtbelysning på just detta
            område. Vi ser nu hur svenska vapen, exporterade till den jugoslaviska
            regimen, används för att beskjuta FN:s olika hjälptransporter.
          </note>
          <note>
            Jugoslavien var under 1980-talet det tredje största köparlandet
            när det gäller svenska vapen.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vi har sett hur vapenexporten till andra diktaturer, som Saudiarabien
            eller under 1980-talet Irak och
          </note>
          <note>
            Saddam Hussein, motverkar möjligheterna till en demokratisk utveckling.
            Vi har också bidragit till att sälja vapen till det pågående kriget
            mellan Indien och
          </note>
          <note>
            Pakistan.

            Det är inte bra att bidra till diktaturer, att beväpna konflikthärdar,
            utan vi måste se till att avveckla den svenska vapenexporten.
          </note>
          <note>
            Jag vill slutligen, fru talman, säga att jag självfallet stöder
            alla Miljöpartiets reservationer, men för tids vinnande yrkar
            jag bifall endast till reservationerna nr

            Fru talman! Lars Ångström talar om vikten av ett tidigt förebyggande.
            Det är alldeles rätt. Man hade kunnat göra mer. Man kunde kanske
            ha utvidgat
          </note>
          <note>
            Unpredep till norra Albanien. Det finns många saker som hade
            kunnat göras. Därför finns det anledning att vara kritisk när
            det gäller det som inte gjordes i uppmarschen till katastrofen
            i Kosovo.
          </note>
          <note>
            Men det finns något som är ännu viktigare. Det handlar om att
            vi också skall bygga strukturer så att vi inte ens behöver skicka
            förebyggande trupper. Jag tänker naturligtvis på de samarbetsstrukturer
            som vi bygger i Europa. Det är svårt att förstå Miljöpartiets
            engagemang när det gäller att vi skall förebygga samtidigt som
            Miljöpartiet vill dra sig ur något av det viktigaste när det gäller
            förebyggande, nämligen den europeiska unionen, vars hela syfte
            är att fläta ihop länderna, att skapa en samverkan som gör att
            vi inte hamnar i konflikt och krig med varandra. Det är oerhört
            svårt att förstå att Miljöpartiet vill dra Sverige ur en av de
            allra viktigaste förebyggande åtgärderna för att främja frihet
            och fred i Europa.

            Fru talman! Jag tror inte att det är så svårt att förstå varför
            Miljöpartiet vill dra sig ur EU. Det är helt riktigt som Göran
            Lennmarker säger att samarbetet mellan stater i sig är fredsskapande.
            Integration på olika plan mellan länder är fredsskapande och krigsförebyggande,
            och det finns många exempel i världen på s.k. säkerhetsgemenskaper
            där staters samarbete på olika plan har gjort att krig betraktas
            som en omöjlighet.
          </note>
          <note>
            Den här typen av samarbete har vi sett växa fram inom politiska
            unioner, som i EU, men också mellan stater utanför politiska unioner.
            Vi har under 1900-
          </note>
          <note>
            talet sett just en säkerhetsgemenskap utvecklas mellan Norge
            och Sverige som då inte har varit med i en union, men det är ett
            sådant starkt samarbete och en sådan stark integration att vi
            betraktar krig som en omöjlighet. Det bör heller inte vara någon
            överraskning för Göran Lennmarker att EU handlar om mycket mer
            än bara om samarbete som i sig är fredsskapande. EU har också
            en rad andra mål som vi betraktar som negativa, och konsekvenserna
            av det projekt som nu utvecklas är så negativa att de överväger
            de fördelar som samarbetet i sig har.
          </note>

            Fru talman! FN och OSSE är viktiga och utgör också viktiga delar
            i den europeiska säkerhetsordningen. Det är rätt. På samma sätt
            är EU och Nato också viktiga delar i detta. Vi har ett samarbete
            där de flätas in i varandra. Det tror jag är oerhört centralt
            när det gäller att bygga frihet och fred i Europa.

            Lars Ångström nämnde exemplet med Sverige och Norge. Vi skall
            betänka att en stor del av det nära samarbetet mellan Sverige
            och Norge har sin grund i
          </note>
          <note>
            EU-samarbetet. Det intensiva och öppna samarbete som vi har i
            Norden är i många delar ett resultat av

            EU också långt innan vi själva kom in i EU.

            Vi försökte en gång i tiden t.ex. att bygga en ekonomisk gemenskap
            i Norden. Det misslyckades. Det klarade vi inte av på egen hand.
            Men vi fick en sådan bakvägen, via EU som de facto skapade Efta
            och därmed den fria rörligheten för både varor och tjänster. När
            det gäller personer ordnade vi det själva på egen hand i Norden
            och har snarare spritt det till resten av Europa.

            Det är viktigt att man också är med där andra länder är med.
            Man kan ju inte bygga upp ett samarbete bara med sig själv; man
            får acceptera de organisationer som finns med alla sina vårtor
            och blemmor och vad det nu är. Vi kan naturligtvis ha lite olika
            synpunkter på detta. FN har sina problem. OSSE har sina problem.
            EU har sina problem. Nato har sina problem. Visst är det så, men
            man måste ju faktiskt samarbeta där de andra länderna finns. Man
            kan ju inte sätta Sverige alldeles för sig självt och samarbeta
            för sig själv. Man måste vara med i de samarbetsorganisationer
            som finns. EU är, och växer alltmer fram som, en central del när
            det gäller att säkra frihet och fred i Europa. Varför vill Miljöpartiet
            att Sverige skall dra sig ur detta? Det är faktiskt alldeles obegripligt
            i skenet av det anförande som Lars Ångström nyss höll.

            Det är inte konstigt, eftersom de negativa konsekvenserna av

            Fru talman! Jag delar inte heller Göran Lennmarkers uppfattning
            om att samarbetet måste ske inom organisationer. Man kan samarbeta
            på ett multilateralt plan. Jag tror också, fru talman, att Göran
            Lennmarker överdriver betydelsen av EU:s existens för det samarbete
            som finns även utanför EU. Jag tror att samarbete är resultatet
            av ett behov av att samarbeta och inte ett resultat av att en
            viss struktur existerar.

            vanföreställningen om neutralitetspolitiken och vår militära alliansfrihet
            blir jag bestört. Den militära alliansfriheten och neutralitetspolitiken
            har inte bara hjälpt oss att behålla freden i vårt land. Den har

            Möjligheten för vårt land att stå utanför krig i vårt närområde
            gagnas fortfarande bäst av den militära alliansfriheten, och det
            är den som hela analysen bygger på. Den ger oss också de bästa
            förutsättningarna för att i vårt närområde stärka de baltiska
            staternas suveränitet, något som ofta åberopas som en angelägenhet,
            inte minst från Moderaterna, Folkpartiet och Kristdemokraterna.
            Vi menar att vi sköter detta bäst inom ramen för den militära
            alliansfriheten.

            Sverige kan vara en aktör i arbetet för en alleuropeisk säkerhetsordning.
            Vi ansvarar själva för försvaret av vårt territorium och bidrar
            samtidigt till säkerheten i omvärlden. Vi gör det genom ett aktivt
            deltagande i FN, EU, OSSE, Partnerskap för fred, Euroatlantiska
            partnerskapsrådet. Tillsammans med Nato när Nato gör fredsfrämjande

            Modern säkerhetspolitik kräver att det militära och nationella
            perspektivet på säkerhet vidgas. Vi måste anlägga ett civilt och
            gränsöverskridande förhållningssätt. Samtidigt behöver Sverige
            ett militärt försvar som en livförsäkring för militära hot riktade
            mot statens suveränitet eller överlevnad. Men vi behöver också
            ett brett register av säkerhetspolitiska verktyg för att möta
            alla de icke-militära hot som alltmer blir en realitet i dag.
            De här verktygen innebär att vi skall samarbeta i internationella
            organ med vardagliga icke-militära relationer. Det sker framför
            allt inom EU i dag. Vi skall använda de verktyg som handel och
            bistånd ger. Flykting- och migrationspolitiken är andra. All samverkan
            inom internationella organisationer internationellt och globalt
            är av största vikt för detta.

            Jag menar att en förändrad syn på säkerhet ger nya möjligheter

            har givit
          </note>
          <note>
            Sverige förutsättningar att anpassa det militära försvaret till
            hotbilden och sänka de militära försvarskostnaderna. Svenskt försvar
            har fått en tydligare inriktning på internationell fredsfrämjande
            verksamhet. Samtidigt har det försäkrat oss om att det svenska
            försvaret har en god anpassningsförmåga i händelse av kriser och
            krig i vårt närområde.

            Sverige i dag. Det är ganska fantastiskt att kunna stå här och
            säga detta, samtidigt som det pågår en väpnad konflikt på Balkan.
            De djupt tragiska konflikterna i förra Jugoslavien som drabbat
            miljontals människor innebär inte ett ökat hot mot Sverige. Där
            är jag inte överens med Lars Ohly, att det här skulle innebära
            ett ökat militärt hot. Jag menar att lokala och regionala krig
            i Afrika, Asien eller Europa inte haft den spridningsrisk som
            de hade under det kalla krigets dagar.

            Under 90-talet har detta helt förändrats. Den tidigare ideologiskt
            blockuppdelade världen innebar per automatik att många länder
            engagerade sig på respektive sida när ett krig bröt ut, och därmed
            var spridningen ett faktum. Men det ser vi inte i dag, och därför
            är inte kriget i Kosovo ett hot mot Sverige. Det må vara brutalt
            och hemskt, och det är smärtsamt att se, men det är inte ett hot
            som innebär att vi behöver revidera vår hotbild.

            utvecklingen är fortsatt osäker, skriver vi i betänkandet, men
            inte heller det utgör ett militärt hot mot Sverige. Rysslands
            svårigheter, framför allt ekonomiskt, skulle i vilket annat land

            sådana påfrestningar?

            Det ryska samhället har trots stora umbäranden alltmer stabiliserats
            i en demokratisk ordning, som visserligen behöver fördjupas och
            förstärkas men som finns där som en oåterkallelig process. Den
            ryska krigsmakten är kraftigt reducerad. Den skulle inte, skriver
            vi i betänkandet, kunna genomföra något invasionsföretag mot Sverige
            inom åtminstone en tioårsperiod. Ryssland deltar aktivt och konstruktivt
            i arbetet för att finna en politisk lösning på Kosovokonflikten.
            Även om moderaterna desperat försöker vifta lite med kommunistspöket
            igen eller åtminstone med Rysslands farlighet, biter det inte
            på majoriteten i utskottet. Vi menar att Ryssland inte i dag är
            ett militärt hot mot Sverige. Det är dags att revidera den svenska
            hotbilden på den punkten, även för moderaterna.

            FN är den viktigaste organisationen för fred och säkerhet. Det
            är inom ramen för säkerhetsrådet som beslut av den karaktär som
            vi här tidigare diskuterat skall fattas, beslut om militär intervention.
            Men händelserna i Kosovo gjorde det omöjligt att bara stå vid
            sidan av och se på. Jag är inte villig att fördöma den insats
            som Nato har gjort. Jag kan se den som en logisk följd av de tragiska
            misslyckanden som FN:s säkerhetsråd då stod inför. Det är naturligtvis
            för framtiden väldigt viktigt att vi tar lärdom av det här, att
            vi stärker FN:s förmåga till konfliktförebyggande arbete. Jag
            menar att man måste utveckla alla de instrument som finns i kapitel
            6 i FN-stadgan. Även

            Miljöpartiets Lars Ångström var inne på detta. Jag tror att man
            med ett mera systematiskt arbete med alla de åtgärder som finns
            i kapitel 6 skulle kunna hitta en ordning där man på ett tidigare
            stadium med icke-militära medel kan komma till rätta med fler
            konflikter.

            för utrikes- och säkerhetspolitiken. Man måste också skapa en
            kraftfull krishanteringsmekanism. EU stod pinsamt tomhänt när
            kriget i Kosovo bröt ut. Det är hög tid att FN stärker sitt arbete

            Man säger att vi inte skall ansöka om medlemskap i dag, men samtidigt
            håller man frågan öppen. När är den dagen inne när Sverige skall
            lämna in en ansökan? Skulle vi ha varit med i dag?

            De reservationer som Miljöpartiet har lagt fram handlar om CFE-fördraget.
            Man önskar att Sverige skall ansluta sig till detta, eftersom

            Vi menar att denna fråga fortfarande kan hållas öppen. I november

            fortsätta att undersöka vilka konsekvenser det skulle ha för det

            Miljöpartiet vill att Sverige skall lämna VEU. Det ligger naturligtvis
            i den isolationistiska traditionen att inte vara med i EU och
            inte vara med i VEU. Vi menar att den insikt och den information
            Sverige får genom det aktiva observatörskapet i VEU är värdefullt
            och skall behållas.

            Det gäller såväl Vänsterpartiet som Miljöpartiet. Här vill jag
            påtala att Sverige är en av de största bidragsgivarna till minröjning
            i världen. Sedan 90-talets början har Sverige givit 450 miljoner
            kronor till minröjning. Vi har varit ivriga tillskyndare av alla
            konventioner. Vi har bidragit mer än de flesta. Även om detta
            i procent av försvarsanslagen inte slår så hårt, är det en vits
            att andra länder delar bördorna. Det gör engagemanget för frågan
            större.

            Sverige skall förhålla sig när de baltiska länderna väljer att
            ansöka om medlemskap. Vi skriver i betänkandet att vi tycker att
            det är positivt att Sverige har bidragit till att göra det möjligt
            för dem att själva välja sin säkerhetspolitiska linje. De väljer
            Natomedlemskap. Det är säkert mycket positivt för dem. Men det
            är deras sak att själva avgöra hur de vill välja sin säkerhetspolitiska
            linje. Eftersom Sverige inte är
          </note>
          <note>

            När det gäller krigsmaterielexporten är Vänsterpartiet och Miljöpartiet
            minimalister, Moderaterna vill liberalisera, och vi lägger oss
            lite grann emellan.

          <note>
            Vi menar att en svensk krigsmaterielindustri måste fortleva och
            ha bra villkor. Men den gemensamma kod för krigsmaterielexport
            som vi eftersträvar skall vara sådan att den totalt sett minskar
            produktionen av krigsmateriel i världen.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det kan tyckas vara en petitess när Moderaterna säger att krigsmaterielexporten
            skall ta sin utgångspunkt i svenska restriktiva linjer, och vi
            menar att man skall försöka eftersträva en restriktiv ordning.
            Ett nyckelord i den moderata reservationen är utgångspunkt. Man
            kan gå hur långt som helst från utgångspunkten och ändå ha tagit
            den utgångspunkten. Därför anser vi att skrivningen inte var bra.
            Det ledde till en moderat reservation.

            Men om vi skall bygga en europeisk säkerhetsordning, Viola Furubjelke,
            kan den inte bygga på neutralitet. Det går inte att bygga en europeisk
            säkerhetsordning om länderna säger att de är neutrala. Den bygger
            på att vi tar ansvar för varandra. Man kan möjligtvis säga att
            ett och annat land skall stå vid sidan av ett byggande av en europeisk
            säkerhetsordning. Det kan vara undantagsländer som säger att de

            Herr talman! Göran Lennmarkers replik avslöjar väldigt tydligt
            hur synen på konfliktlösning är i Moderata samlingspartiet. Han
            menar att Sverige inte skall kunna vara med i en förstärkt utrikes-

            för den militära alliansfriheten.

            Jag har rakt motsatt uppfattning. Jag menar att med undvikande
            av ömsesidiga försvarsåtaganden som de stadgas i Natos och VEU:s
            traktater kan Sverige utföra mycket. Det var under ledning av
            en socialdemokratisk utrikesminister - tillsammans med en socialdemokratisk
            finsk utrikesminister, också från ett alliansfritt land - som
            förslaget lades fram om att stärka den krishanteringsmekanism
            som finns i EU

            och stimulera EU-utvidgningen för länderna runt Östersjön. Vi
            gör det genom förtroendeskapande minoritetsstöd till de här länderna.

            i

            Kosovo. Jag är övertygad om att Ryssland kommer att spela en

            läggs fram. Jag menar att det stärker Rysslands anseende internationellt,

            rätt att i fortsättningen agera på detta sätt. Detta sade Kofi

            dem, men jag skall ändå upprepa vad som står i reservationen:
            "Det finns i dag ingen anledning till att ompröva den militära
            alliansfriheten, men full handlingsfrihet bör råda inför den fortsatta
            säkerhetspolitiska utvecklingen i Europa. Skulle Nato utvidgas
            med de baltiska staterna och Finland kommer frågan i ett nytt
            läge."
          </note>
          <note>
            Det är den handlingsfriheten, den öppenheten och den attityden
            som Folkpartiet har.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det återspeglas också i den andra fråga som Viola
          </note>
          <note>
            Furubjelke ställer, nämligen om de baltiska staternas medlemskap.
            Utrikesutskottet skriver så här: "Sverige har vid upprepade tillfällen
            uttalat stöd för de baltiska länderna rätt att själva fatta sina
            säkerhetspolitiska beslut." Ja, naturligtvis - allt annat vore
            ju orimligt.

            Herr talman! Min fråga till Karl-Göran Biörsmark är berättigad.
            När började vi ifrågasätta den gällande säkerhetspolitiska linjen
            så länge den fortfarande gällde? Det är inte brukligt i något
            land. Att på det här sättet försvaga, ifrågasätta och därmed underminera
            den svenska militära alliansfriheten är ett försåtligt arbete
            från Folkpartiets, Moderaternas och kd:s sida.
          </note>
          <note>
            Dessutom är frågan berättigad utifrån ett TV-
          </note>
          <note>
            inslag som jag såg i går, där Folkpartiets toppkvinna till Europaparlamentet
            Marit Paulsen fick frågan om
          </note>
          <note>
            Natomedlemskap och Folkpartiets hållning i detta.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det var fullständigt förvirrade svar. Hon hävdade att detta inte
            är Folkpartiets mening - nej, Partnerskap för fred handlar det
            om. Sedan skulle man skydda de baltiska staternas säkerhet inom
            Partnerskap för fred.
          </note>
          <note>
            Jag undrar hur väl förankrad den här synen är i Folkpartiet,
            om man verkligen har tillräckligt på fötterna för att gå ut och
            underminera svensk säkerhetspolitik på det här sättet.

            Herr talman! Jag tror att Viola Furubjelke skall använda lite
            mindre ord när det gäller den svenska alliansfriheten, speciellt
            mot bakgrund av allt det som har kommit fram under senare tid.
            När vi tittar tillbaka på Sveriges agerande under årens lopp ser
            vi hur det nu kommer fram vilka kontakter som i krissituationer
            har funnits under hand, gömt och hemligt, med både USA och Nato.

            Varningen för att vi underminerar alliansfriheten, som Viola

            Den har faktiskt underminerats under flera år. Vår trovärdighet
            på alliansfrihetens område har därför också underminerats, inte
            minst av socialdemokraternas partiledare.

            Vi har den här öppna attityden. Vi är med i det europeiska säkerhetsarbetet.
            Vi ser Nato som en naturlig del i detta. Det är omöjligt att i
            dag säga hur det kommer att se ut om fem-tio år. Men Folkpartiet
            har attityden att ha dörren öppen för ett Natomedlemskap i framtiden,
            beroende på vad som händer med Finland, beroende på vad som händer
            med de baltiska staterna. Den handlingsberedskapen vill vi ha
            kvar.

            Herr talman! Socialdemokratin har alltid varit en internationell
            rörelse. Vi har varit aktiva utrikespolitiskt. Jag har som socialdemokrat
            absolut ingenting att skämmas för när det gäller vårt förhållningssätt
            utrikespolitiskt och vad den militära alliansfriheten har inneburit
            för Sverige. Jag är stolt över Olof Palme. Jag är stolt över Ingvar
            Carlssons arbete och många andra socialdemokratiska ledares arbete.
          </note>
          <note>
            Jag hävdar med bestämdhet att den gräns för den militära alliansfriheten
            som vi har satt vid att inte ingå ömsesidiga försvarsåtaganden
            ger oss möjligheter att agera relativt fritt på den internationella
            arenan, tillsammans med de aktörer som vi också finner främjar
            samma säkerhetspolitiska mål som vi själva omfattar.

            Sedan kanske en del saker inte syns fullt ut. Vi hjälpte Sydafrika
            att bli fritt från apartheid. Det skedde inte öppet. Det skedde
            i det fördolda. Andra saker har också skett i det fördolda. Historien
            får utvisa vem som hade rätt eller fel. Jag vill bara återupprepa
            att svensk socialdemokrati har ett gott samvete. Vi har verkat
            för fred i Sverige, vi har verkat för fred i världen. Det har
            vi gjort, och vi kan vara stolta över det.

            Vården: Om man ser tillbaka på det som har hänt under senare
            delen av 90-talet kan man konstatera att de besparingar som regeringen

            När det gäller anslutning till CFE-avtalet vill regeringen avvakta
            till november. Det finns inga skäl att avvakta eller att hålla
            denna avvaktande attityd till ett avtal som begränsar militär
            upprustning. Jag tycker att det förhållningssättet står i bjärt
            kontrast till hur tidigare socialdemokratiska regeringar har förhållit
            sig till nedrustningsavtal. När Viola Furubjelke säger att det
            är att slå in öppna dörrar att föreslå detta förstår jag inte
            varför vi inte kan ansöka om att få bli en del av detta avtal
            redan i dag. Jag hoppas bara att andra länder inte följer Sveriges
            exempel, att inta den här avvaktande attityden.

            Furubjelke vet att det inte är Miljöpartiets politik att isolera

            ha en annan hållning, nämligen att välja var man vill vara med,
            var man vill samarbeta. Det är det som ligger till grund för Miljöpartiets

            att regeringen slår sig för bröstet för det vi gör. Viola Furubjelke
            sade att det inte spelar så stor roll om det inte är så många
            procent av försvarsbudgeten som går till minröjning när det är
            så mycket vi gör. Men jag tycker inte att det handlar om procent.

            Det handlar om mindre än 2 %. Det finns ingen anledning att göra
            ett motsatsförhållande mellan det vi satsar och det andra skall
            satsa. Har vi, som Sverige nu har, bäst teknik i världen på det

            För oss i Miljöpartiet handlar det i första hand vart svenska
            vapen skall exporteras. Det är inte bra som nu sker, att svenska
            sprängämnen har hamnat i de minor som diktaturen Saddam Hussein
            har spridit ut över irakiska Kurdistan. Det innebär att svenskt
            sprängämne varje dag lemlästar i första hand kvinnor och barn
            i irakiska Kurdistan. Sådan export av sprängämnen är inte bra.
            På samma sätt är det när svenska vapen i händerna på serber används
            mot FN-
          </note>

            styrkor. Sådan vapenexport är inte bra.

            Miljöpartiet är väldigt konsekvent i att vi inte vill att Sverige
            skall exportera vapen till diktaturer. Det vore bra att få ett
            uttryckligt stöd för detta från socialdemokraterna. Det är en
            ståndpunkt som de åtminstone tidigare har intagit.

            när jag gick igenom Miljöpartiets reservationer. Det berodde på
            tidsbrist. Lampan hade börjat att blinka, och då låg det nära
            till hands att bara klassificera Miljöpartiets reservationer som
            minimalistiska. Självfallet är jag skyldig Miljöpartiet en förklaring.

            När det gäller VEU och CFE har jag redan lämnat en förklaring.
            Men jag skall också förklara hur vi ser på krigsmaterielexporten.

            Socialdemokraterna ställer sig klädsamt mittemellan, säger Lars
            Ångström. Det må förhålla sig på det sättet, men det har naturligtvis
            sin förklaring.

            Vi anser att Sverige bör ha en krigsmaterielindustri som kan
            fungera om vi skulle behöva materielen eller en ökning av produktionen.
            För att ha råd med detta behöver vi också exportera vapen, vilket
            är väl känt. Exporten är restriktiv. Den omgärdas av riktlinjer
            som vi är väldigt måna om och som utrikesutskottet upprepar och
            betonar i årliga betänkanden.

            Det finns också en rådgivande nämnd som är tillsatt för att granska
            kritiska ärenden. Nämnden måste ta sin uppgift på fullt allvar
            och granska ärendena utifrån dessa kriterier.

            I korthet innebär det att försvaret är vår sista försvarslinje,
            som Olof Palme en gång sade. Vi behöver försvaret som en livförsäkring.
            Därför måste vi ha en krigsmaterielproduktion och därmed också
            en export, men, som sagt, denna export skall vara restriktiv.

            Miljöpartiet och Vänsterpartiet hamnar på ena sidan och tar inte
            fullt ut ansvar för den säkerhetspolitik som vi till en del är
            överens om. Moderaterna är för överambitiösa i sin iver att gynna
            krigsmaterielindustrin utifrån ett annat synsätt än det som jag
            nyss har redogjort för, nämligen det att vi behöver en krigsmaterielindustri
            för att själva kunna hålla oss med ett försvar.

            Kriget på Balkan ställer en rad frågor på sin spets.
          </note>
          <note>
            Den viktigaste av alla frågor är att det konfliktförebyggande
            arbetet måste få mycket större tyngd i det internationella samfundet.
            Med stor bitterhet kan vi konstatera att den kosovoalbanske ledaren
            Rugovas icke-våldspolitik inte fick något större internationellt
            stöd. Först när konflikten eskalerade och övergreppen i Kosovo
            ledde till UCK-gerillans aktioner togs situationen i Kosovo på
            verkligt allvar. Våldet segrade alltså. Det är oacceptabelt och
            ovärdigt en värld som vill kalla sig civiliserad.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det internationella samfundet saknar kraftfulla instrument för
            att ingripa i förebyggande syfte, och detta måste ändras, tycker
            vi. Det är bra att regeringen nu presenterar ett handlingsprogram
            för konflikthantering. Det är ett steg på vägen, och vi skall
            noga studera detta. Samtidigt är behovet av ett fungerande
          </note>
          <note>
            FN större än någonsin. För att FN skall fungera bättre behövs

            skall återta sin ledande roll. Vetorätten i säkerhetsrådet bör

          <note>
            En utvidgning av folkrätten som ger möjlighet att ingripa förebyggande
            är nödvändig. Det ansvaret måste också gälla konflikter utanför

            Kriget i Kosovo visar också att det behövs en fungerande europeisk

          </note>
          <note>
            EU behöver bli bättre både på förebyggande arbete och på att
            hantera kriser med militära medel. Detta är inte detsamma som
            ett gemensamt försvar eller en gemensam armé. Det gäller att vara
            ganska varsam med orden i den debatt som nu förs i Europa om krishantering.
            Europeisk krishantering och gemensamt territorialförsvar är skilda
            saker.

            När det så gäller den militära alliansfriheten menar vi i Centerpartiet
            att det är den ram som med nu kända förutsättningar bäst förmår
            tillgodose svenska säkerhetspolitiska intressen. I det konstaterandet
            finns en handlingsfrihet att från tid till annan anpassa samarbetsformerna.

            Sverige samarbetar i dag med Nato på en mängd områden, inte minst
            i fredsfrämjande internationella insatser. Vår militära alliansfrihet
            utgör inget hinder för det. Vi menar att stabiliteten i vår del
            av världen eller vårt lands säkerhet inte skulle förbättras genom
            ett svenskt medlemskap i Nato.

            Herr talman! Vi måste konstatera att det internationella säkerhetspolitiska
            läget har påverkats av kriget på Balkan. Osäkerheten ökar också
            i Bosnien,
          </note>
          <note>
            Makedonien och andra omkringliggande länder. Det ställer självklart
            krav på internationell beredskap.
          </note>
          <note>
            Men Sveriges läge har inte förändrats i form av ökad hotbild
            mot oss till följd av den här konflikten.
          </note>
          <note>
            Fortfarande gäller att en invasion av Sverige inom en tioårsperiod
            inte är möjlig och inte heller sannolik, förutsatt att Sverige
            har en grundläggande försvarsförmåga. Detta har inte förändrats
            av kriget i Kosovo eller av att Ryssland bytt premiärminister.
            Däremot är det angeläget att nära följa Kosovokrigets inverkan
            på den säkerhetspolitiska utvecklingen i Europa på kortare och
            på längre sikt.

            "kontrollera att de säkerhetspolitiska bedömningarna i 1999 års
            kontrollstation består". Uppgörelsen som Centerpartiet träffat
            med regeringen baseras på de slutsatser om säkerhetspolitiken
            som Försvarsberedningen presenterat, såvitt jag förstår i full
            enighet.

            I det konfliktförebyggande och fredsskapande arbetet i Europa
            har EU en avgörande roll. EU:s utvidgning österut till länderna
            i Central- och Östeuropa, inklusive Baltikum, innebär en historisk
            möjlighet för EU att medverka till ökad stabilitet och säkerhet
            på vår kontinent. För Centerpartiet är utvidgningen en mycket
            central fråga.

            är andra viktiga instrument för att lösa gemensamma gränsöverskridande

            Säkerhetspolitiken måste över huvud taget gå mot förebyggande
            arbete på det civila planet. Större insatser där skulle spara
            stort lidande och dessutom ge betydligt större resultat i förhållande
            till insatta resurser än att komma efteråt och lösa katastrofer
            och förhindra redan uppkomna krig eller krigshandlingar.

            Det är t.ex. betydligt bättre att förebygga att minor läggs ut
            än att tvingas till enorma ansträngningar för minröjning. Nu finns
            minorna där. Vi måste fortsätta och utöka arbetet för att befria
            människor från den terror som utlagda minor innebär.

            Fru talman! Sverige är av både geografiska och säkerhetspolitiska
            skäl mer beroende av en väl fungerande gemensam utrikes- och säkerhetspolitik
            i EU än de flesta andra EU-länder. Vi ligger nära Ryssland, och
            vi är inte Natomedlemmar. Det ligger därmed i vårt nationella

            förmår att exportera stabilitet och säkerhet.
          </note>
          <note>
            Inte minst gäller detta förmågan att inom ramen för den gemensamma
            utrikes- och säkerhetspolitiken förebygga att krig och kriser
            uppstår och att tidigt hantera dem om de ändå uppkommer. All erfarenhet
            visar att inbördeskrig är oerhört svåra att stoppa när de väl

            De förebyggande insatserna måste vara lika tidiga som tydliga.
            I annat fall riskerar vi att få se en rad andra i dag potentiella

            Den gemensamma utrikes- och säkerhetspolitiken är en mycket viktig

            EU:s betydelse för freden är större än bara GUSP. Den ekonomiska

            projektet hittills i historien. Det ömsesidiga beroendet gör inte
            bara krig otänkbart utan också omöjligt. Det kan inte brytas upp

            alla delar med undantag av det territoriella försvaret. Där finns

            I Amsterdamfördraget fördes Petersbergsuppgifterna in i den gemensamma
            utrikes- och säkerhetspolitiken. Det rör sig om humanitära insatser,
            fredsbevarande insatser, insatser med stridskrafter i krishantering
            och fredsskapande åtgärder. Det är i sig inget kontroversiellt.
            Som nämnts tidigare i dag är detta något som FN kan utföra och
            har kunnat utföra under den tid då Sverige har varit medlem.

            EU kan anlita Västeuropeiska unionen för att utföra de beslut
            som har försvarsmässiga konsekvenser, och VEU kan i sin tur låna
            strukturer av Nato. Märk väl att det inte är fråga om ett territorialförsvar.
            Det är inte fråga om att VEU:s artikel 5 skall lyftas in, eller
            har lyfts in, i EU-fördraget. Det varken bör eller kommer att
            bli så. Det finns ingen enighet mellan medlemsländerna, vilket
            krävs för att lyfta in artikel 5. Även om vi gång på gång i Sverige
            hör politiker vara ute och ropa att nu kommer vargen har vi knappast
            sett några tecken på detta.

            I många år nu har vi hört politiker prata om vikten av att bygga

            velat eller kunnat konkretisera vad detta innebär. Min uppfattning,
            och Moderaternas uppfattning, är att Sverige bör vara med i en
            alleuropeisk säkerhetsordnings alla delar. Regeringen saknar tyvärr
            förhållningssätt till centrala delar av detta, t.ex.

            Nato har efter det kalla kriget förändrats och fått en allt viktigare
            politisk och säkerhetspolitisk roll. Nato är också förändrat i
            den bemärkelsen att en första utvidgningsomgång har genomförts
            och att flera nya medlemmar inom kort kan förväntas accepteras
            - nya medlemmar i vårt närområde. Det faktum att alltfler av våra
            grannar kommer med i Nato ställer krav på en modernisering av
            det svenska synsättet. Skall vi fortsätta att stå utanför när
            grannarna är med? När skall vi ställa oss neutrala? I vilka konflikter
            som man ser som möjliga skall vi ställa oss neutrala?

            behov av nu och som man kan se behov av i framtiden. Utan Nato

            av omvärldsutvecklingen. Den kan vi påverka genom att aktivt medverka
            i byggandet av en europeisk säkerhetsordnings alla delar och genom
            integrering i de västliga strukturerna av länderna i Öst- och

            framtid och inte till Sveriges historia.

            Herr talman! Inom Säkerhetspolitiken är det, som inom de allra
            flesta andra områden, det förebyggande arbetet som är viktigast.
            Jag blev väldigt glad när
          </note>

            Anna Lindh i dag sade det där om att ett grams förebyggande ger
            kilon tillbaka av faktisk säkerhet i framtiden. Jag håller med
            om det. Men då måste vi också fylla på vågskålen med förebyggande
            insatser och ge det förebyggande arbetet än större betydelse och
            än mer resurser.

            Att ge människor möjlighet till försörjning, till demokratisk
            utveckling och till deltagande är därför den viktigaste åtgärden
            för att undvika konflikter -
          </note>
          <note>
            och därmed en utveckling där vapen står för argumenten. Efter
            en väpnad konflikt, då återuppbyggnaden kan starta, är också deltagande
            och lyhördhet för lokala behov mycket viktigt. I detta arbete
            kan Sverige spela en mycket stor roll. Det är också väsentligt
            med kvinnornas behov och att kvinnornas deltagande i det här arbetet
            stärks. Om kvinnorna får spela en stor roll, och om kvinnors trygghet
            kan säkerställas, har det stor betydelse för den framtida stabiliteten.

            samband med det arbete som regeringen nu genomför i syfte att
            ta fram ett handlingsprogram för konfliktförebyggande insatser
            anser jag, herr talman, att kvinnors roll och behov nogsamt bör
            prövas.

            Ett viktigt och nödvändigt villkor för att människor efter ett
            krig skall kunna flytta tillbaka och utveckla sitt land är att
            det sker minröjning. Insatser på det här området sker också inom
            Försvarsmakten.
          </note>
          <note>
            Också Sida och Räddningsverket har budgetar och arbetar inom
            det här området. Det är därför väldigt svårt att få en överblick
            över utvecklingen och omfattningen. Det är väldigt lätt att man
            hänvisar till andras åtgärder och att sammanhangen och samordningen
            förloras.
          </note>
          <note>
            Därför vill vi att regeringen årligen för riksdagen presenterar
            en skrivelse där den svenska internationella minröjningsverksamheten
            redovisas på samma sätt som sker när man redovisar vapenexporten.
            Detta är nödvändigt för att vi skall kunna utveckla, utvärdera
            ompröva och förbättra den svenska minröjningskapaciteten. I samband
            med denna skrivelse kan ledamöter och partier lägga fram förslag
            och föreslå förändringar, och ett samlat grepp kan tas i denna
            viktiga och livsnödvändiga fråga.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det är också av vikt att den svenska minröjningskapaciteten förbättras.
            Inom Försvarsmaktens område utgör den, som vi har hört förut i
            debatten, bara två promille. Om vi menar allvar med att minröjningen
            är viktig måste detta också avspeglas i budgetens siffror. Vänsterpartiet
            har lagt fram ett konkret förslag om att vi skall utöka minröjningskapaciteten
            inom Försvarsmakten från 70 miljoner kronor till 200 miljoner
            kronor per år.

            Vi har också krävt att den svenska vapenindustrin successivt

            Trots denna grundinställning vill vi ha synpunkter på den svenska
            försvarsindustrin. Vi vill kunna påverka den export av vapen som
            sker här och nu. Med ett minskat svenskt försvar följer att vi
            inte kan ha en försvarsindustri som under det kalla krigets dagar.
          </note>
          <note>
            Antalet anställda inom försvarsindustrin har minskat successivt
            och många försvarsindustrier arbetar också hårt på en omställning
            till civil produktion. Det här är bra.
          </note>
          <note>
            Regeringen har dock ett ansvar för att den här industrin kan

          <note>
            Det har också kommit in mycket utländskt ägande, och alltfler
            samarbetar över gränserna. Detta får till följd att svenska vapen
            produceras i andra länder.
          </note>

            Svenska komponenter ingår i andra länders vapen och vice versa.
          </note>
          <note>
            Därför behövs det regler som de svenska för att kunna hålla en
            sträng kontroll även över hur vapen används och över vem man exporterar
            till.
          </note>
          <note>
            I Sverige är reglerna för vapenexport jämförelsevis stränga.
            I utskottets skrivning står det att man fäster stor vikt vid att
            en samsyn växer fram, en sådan samsyn vad gäller krigsmaterielexport
            som i stor utsträckning baseras på ett restriktivt synsätt av
            det slag som Sverige tillämpar i dag.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vi tycker att det är en för svag skrivning. Skrivningen "baseras
            på" ger utrymme för en mindre restriktiv hållning som vi inte
            kan gå med på. Därför anser vi att ett viktigt villkor för svenskt
            deltagande i ett utvidgat europeiskt försvarsindustrisamarbete
            är att den svenska hållningen avseende exporten kan upprätthållas.

            Sverige på kort sikt bli föremål för begränsade militära operationer
            eller hot om sådana. Vi måste därför ha en god förmåga att hindra
            att en konflikt sprids till svenskt territorium genom att hävda
            våra nationella intressen och säkerställa att vi kan stå emot

            får vi möjlighet att påverka i olika säkerhetspolitiska forum,

            En viktig förutsättning för att kunna skapa respekt i internationella
            sammanhang är att den personella och materiella kvaliteten hos
            de avdelade enheterna håller en hög standard. Kan detta tillgodoses,
            genom att enheterna direkt kan hämtas från den organisation som
            utformas för nationella försvarsuppgifter, ökar också respekten
            för det svenska totalförsvaret. Kristdemokraterna vill därför
            betona vikten av att verksamheten i totalförsvaret tillgodoser
            de krav som det internationella engagemanget ställer. Krav på
            hög säkerhet och skydd samt god operativ förmåga vid internationella
            insatser medför att vi även stärker vår nationella försvarsförmåga.

            Herr talman! Multifunktionella fredsfrämjande och humanitära
            insatser ställer stora krav på ett nära samspel mellan civila
            och militära resurser. Förmågan att delta i fredsframtvingande
            insatser skall utgöra grunden i utvecklingen och utbildningen
            av olika krigsförband. Regeringen menar att Sverige bör kunna
            delta i den fredsfrämjande och humanitära verksamheten på största
            möjliga bredd med de resurser som står till förfogande. Vi kristdemokrater
            vill att resurser avsätts som leder till att Sverige kan avdela
            förband från alla försvarsgrenar till internationella operationer.

            Härvid är det fortsatta nordiska samarbetet viktigt för att tillvarata
            de nordeuropeiska intressena på bästa sätt. Genom att de nordiska
            länderna samövar sina fredsfrämjande förband blir dessa mer effektiva
            och intressanta vid större insatser. I propositionen anges gemensamma
            insatser i Östersjöområdet och i Arktisoch Barentsområdet, vilket
            bl.a. kräver uthålliga marina resurser. Regeringen säger också
            att samarbetet bör utvecklas dels genom upprättandet av en nordisk
            fredsfrämjande brigad, dels avseende sjö- och flygstridskrafter.

            Konsekvenserna av detta är att Sverige vid internationella insatser
            bör bidra med samtliga typer av stridskrafter som skall ingå i
            den framtida insatsorganisationen.

            I samband med internationella kriser är de uppgifter som åligger
            markstridsförband synnerligen påtagliga. Sverige måste därför
            satsa på sådana förband som flexibelt kan anpassas till aktuell
            uppgift.

            För att vi skall kunna få en modern försvarsmakt som är interoperabel
            med andra länders måste samtidigt utvecklingen av sjö- och luftstridskrafternas
            förmåga att delta i fredsframtvingande operationer i vårt närområde
            fortsätta. De aktiviteter som vi väljer att delta i bör därför
            bidra till att stärka vår förmåga att samverka med Nato- och partnerländerna.

            Detta är ett sätt att bibehålla och utveckla kompetens och operativ
            förmåga över hela skalan, från fred till krig. Vi stöder därför
            en fördjupning av det praktiska regionala PFF-samarbetet med övningar
            i vårt närområde. I takt med att sjö- och flygstridskrafterna
            får en allt bättre samverkansförmåga tror jag att efterfrågan
            kommer att öka.
          </note>
          <note>
            Delar av sjö- och flygstridskrafterna har i dag en sådan interoperabilitet,
            en sådan samverkansförmåga, att de med begränsade kompletteringar
            kan utnyttjas.
          </note>
          <note>
            Ju bättre och bredare interoperabilitet vi får, desto färre förberedelser
            inför övningar och internationella operationer behöver göras.

            Överbefälhavare Owe Wiktorin har hos regeringen hemställt om
            en omprövning av den gällande säkerhetspolitiska bedömningen och
            att därmed sammanhängande planeringsförutsättningar skall göras
            före beslut om försvarets inriktning; detta med tanke på bl.a.
            situationen på Balkan, vilken enligt ÖB måste ges en förnyad säkerhetspolitisk
            bedömning.

            Herr talman! Att vi går in i det nya årtusendet med ett så sargat
            Europa som vi kommer att göra var det väl ingen som kunde tro
            när Berlinmuren föll, järnridån lyftes bort, SALK-avtal och andra
            avtal ingicks, länderna öppnade sina gränser mot varandra, olika
            försvarsorganisationer sträckte sina armar mot de nyfunna vännerna
            i öst, diktaturerna föll och kommunismen klappade ihop.

            Den akuta situationen för Kosovo är i dag katastrofal. Den kosovoalbanska
            befolkningen drivs ut på vägarna som boskap, jagade av tungt beväpnade
            militära fordon utan att i princip ha någonstans att ta vägen.
            Män, kvinnor och barn tvingas fungera som levande sköldar till
            serbernas militär- och ammunitionsförråd. I rapporter sägs att
            minst 250 000 kosovoalbanska män har försvunnit, dvs. de har troligen
            dödats. Även om ca 600 mycket illa medfarna män häromdagen stapplade
            in över gränsen till Makedonien och ungefär lika många till Albanien
            ändrar det ändå inte nämnvärt på antalet försvunna män. De som
            nu kommit till gränsen hade varit internerade i fängelse, torterats
            och misshandlats. De var både psykiskt och fysiskt misshandlade
            och nedgångna.

            den fruktansvärda situation som i dag råder på Balkan. Men jag

            Frågan är om Kosovokriget hade kunnat förhindras och varför det
            i så fall inte skedde. En förklaring är att Europa vid den tid
            då det forna Jugoslavien upplöstes befann sig i något slags euforisk
            yra efter
          </note>

            Glädjen över vad som hänt, över att det kalla krigets dagar var
            slut, över att Tyskland höll på att förenas skymde det mörka som
            också fanns i bilden. En annan orsak är att EU inte var särskilt
            starkt vid den tiden och fullt upptaget av att bygga upp sin egen
            organisation.

            Fru talman! Sveriges försvars- och säkerhetspolitik är två områden
            som ligger mycket nära varandra.
          </note>
          <note>
            Sveriges försvarspolitik är, sett med mina ögon, helt beroende
            av vilken säkerhetspolitik vi har och vad den i sin innersta kärna
            egentligen står för.

            Kriget i det forna Jugoslavien 1991-1995 var ett vidrigt angrepp
            av Serbien mot tre stater som enligt den Jugoslaviska konstitutionen
            hade rätt att bli självständiga om de så ville. Värt att notera
            är att dessa länder förklarade sig självständiga efter demokratiska
            val.
          </note>
          <note>
            Med tanke på vad Serbien åsamkade dessa länder, något som också
            gav Nato och EU en dyrköpt erfarenhet, valde Nato och EU denna
            gång att inte låta
          </note>
          <note>
            Serbien föra dem bakom ljuset. Vetskapen om att det fanns detaljerade
            serbiska planer på att terrorisera den kosovoalbanska befolkningen
            och på så vis få den att fly fick Nato och EU att agera.
          </note>
          <note>
            Argumentet att Nato år 1999 folkrättsvidrigt har angripit en
            stat, Serbien, som inte har angripit en annan faller platt till
            marken. Kosovo hade förutom formell självständighet, som Milosevic
            tog ifrån Kosovo 1989, alla attribut som en självständig stat
            kan tänkas ha. De länder som dogmatiskt framför argument om brott
            mot folkrätten är Ryssland och Kina, länder som gärna vill fortsätta
            att förbehålla sig rätten att brutalt slå ned anspråk om självständighet
            i exempelvis Tjetjenien och Tibet.

            Att FN:s säkerhetsråd inte förmådde att enas om sanktioner mot

          <note>
            Serbiens angrepp mot Kosovo är ett självklart brott mot FN-stadgans
            skrivning om alla folks rätt till självbestämmande. Således borde
            FN:s säkerhetsråd ha agerat. De fem permanenta medlemmarna har
            vetorätt, men den får bara användas ifall egna nationella intressen
            hotas. I detta fall fanns inga sådana intressen som man behövde
            agera för.

            FN som ramverk för att organisera och skapa en stabil värld har
            stor relevans. Men vi vet att FN inte fungerar tillfredsställande
            på grund av att dess medlemsländer inte har givit organisationen
            tillräckligt med medel och befogenheter. Målet måste vara att
            stärka FN. Men detta är ett långsiktigt mål och vi kan inte alltid
            vänta på att det skall uppnås. Vi måste också handla, och ibland
            snabbt.

            I det forna Jugoslavien, mellan åren 1992 och
          </note>
          <note>
            1995, förnedrades FN av Serbien trots lovvärda insatser. Handfallen
            och utan förmåga att hindra de vidriga övergreppen mot exempelvis
            Srebrenica och Zepa tvingades man att lämna dessa städer. Sarajevo
            bombades och besköts dagligen av serberna utan att FN
          </note>
          <note>
            kunde hindra det. Inte heller kunde FN sätta stopp för koncentrationslägret
            Omarska eller massakrer som den i Stupni Do. Först när FN, sanktionerat
            av Natotrupp, intervenerade på marken och i luften vände serbernas
            krigslycka.

            Herr talman! Folkrätten är inte enbart den självständiga statens
            suveränitet utan framför allt folkens rätt att få bli behandlade
            i enlighet med de mänskliga rättigheterna. I FN-stadgan finns
            en spänning mellan dessa två begrepp, men vi tycks mer och mer
            gå mot en tolkning där människans rätt till liv, värdig behandling
            och frihet får större betydelse än gränsernas relativa banalitet.
            Begreppet suveränitet kan väl rimligen bara ha ett värde om det
            bidrar till att skydda människornas integritet. Territoriell okränkbarhet
            får inte vara tyranniets hånfulla argument för att avvisa krav
            på att avrättning, tortyr, våldtäkter och fördrivning skall upphöra.

            Vem vet, om serberna hade behandlat kosovoalbanerna väl från
            början hade kanske strävandena efter självständighet inte blivit
            så starka. Varför skall serberna hävda sin sätt till hänsynslöshet
            och hänvisa till turkarnas behandling av kurderna när de i stället
            kan sträva efter den korrekta behandling av minoriteter som finns
            i flertalet andra europeiska länder. De allra flesta länderna
            i Öst- och Centraleuropa vill tillhöra den fredliga och demokratiska
            sfären och strävar efter medlemskap i EU. Många av dessa länder
            har en eller flera minoritetsgrupper som man strävar efter att
            etablera godkända politiska och kulturella villkor för.

            samtliga kandidatländer till EU, majoriteten av folkopinionen

            Jag blev alldeles nyligen, för kanske tio minuter sedan, uppvaktad
            av en delegation kosovoalbaner som lämnade en skrivelse i dag
            till Kofi Annan och även till utrikesminister Anna Lindh med just
            det krav som jag nu har framställt.

            Herr talman! Genom de ord jag nu har framfört, som bara kan bli
            en summarisk rapsodi, har jag velat peka på att det säkerhetspolitiska
            läget inte är särskilt gott. Även om profilen på det jag sagt
            varit riktad mot situationen i Kosovo har jag ändå perifert nämnt
            olika situationer som ytterligare bekräftar att vi i Sverige på
            intet sätt kan luta oss bekvämt bakåt i fåtöljen, se på vad som
            händer i omvärlden och med några gester vinka bort den fruktansvärda
            scenariot från sinnevärlden. Vi får inte tro att det inte också
            gäller vår egen säkerhet.
          </note>
          <note>
            Herr talman! Kampen för demokrati, mänskliga rättigheter och
            folkrätt i ordens djupaste bemärkelse måste gå vidare. Den får
            aldrig sluta. Sverige finns med i EU och FN. En viktig del av
            vår utrikes- och säkerhetspolitik måste vara att få de länder
            som nu kämpar mot varandra in i olika internationella organisationer
            och gemenskaper.

            Herr talman! Det är väl inte troligt att det blir så mycket debatt
            kring det här betänkandet. Utrikesutskottets betänkande nr 9 är
            kort, och där finns inga reservationer. Det är baserat på en skrivelse
            från regeringen om verksamheten inom OSSE under 1998, och den
            skrivelsen har i sin tur inte föranlett några motioner.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det känns ändå angeläget att ägna några ord och några minuter
            åt den verksamhet som OSSE bedriver, så här mittemellan den säkerhetspolitiska
            och den försvarspolitiska debatten.
          </note>
          <note>
            Under de senaste åren har betydelsen av OSSE:s verksamhet på
            fältet kommit att understrykas. Det handlar om valobservationer
            i de nya demokratierna och om OSSE:s högkommissarie för nationella
            minoriteter. Det rör sig om de många missionerna ute i de olika
            medlemsstaterna, som sysslar med allt från språkfrågor i Estland
            till medling mellan Sydossetien och Georgien. Det handlar om möten
            parlamentariker emellan som är institutionaliserade i den parlamentariska
            församlingen.
          </note>
          <note>
            Sammanfattningsvis är det fråga om en gedigen insats för demokratiuppbyggande
            och till skydd för mänskliga rättigheter, vilken därmed är konfliktförebyggande.
            Den åstadkoms med mycket blygsamma ekonomiska resurser.
          </note>
          <note>
            Självklart är ingen organisation så bra att den inte kan bli
            bättre. De problem som OSSE står inför liknar mycket det som behandlas
            i diskussionen om reformeringen av FN. Hur skall man hitta beslutsformer
            som alla kan acceptera men som ändå gör att en enskild stat inte
            kan motsätta sig för den impopulära beslut? Hur skall man bredda
            basen och det folkliga stödet för OSSE:s verksamhet? Kan man på
            ett bra och inbjudande sätt kritiskt följa upp vad som händer
            med de rekommendationer som OSSE utfärdar t.ex. i samband med
            valobservationer?

            Vi tycker också att det är viktigt att väcka intresse för våra
            frågor hos resten av parlamentet. Allt detta hjälper till att

            av detta.

            Men jag tror att det då också är väsentligt att ta fasta på det
            som regeringen framhåller i sin skrivelse till riksdagen, att
            det gäller att göra det på ett sådant sätt att man integrerar
            olika internationella forum, så att man får till stånd ett tätare
            samarbete mellan de olika organen - OSSE, FN, EU, VEU, Europarådet
            och Nato - där varje organisation får göra det som den är bäst
            på. Det måste vara en huvuduppgift för de närmaste åren, och arbetet
            med den skall helst starta nu.

            Herr talman! Jag är mycket väl medveten om att det här inte är
            rätt tillfälle för synpunkter på budgeten, men jag tycker ändå
            att platsen är ganska väl vald för att uttrycka ett litet önskemål.
            Jag är naturligtvis hundraprocentigt för den överenskommelse som
            har träffats mellan Centern och Socialdemokraterna om försvaret,
            en uppgörelse som i sin snara förlängning syftar bl.a. till att
            Sverige skall ha en större beredskap för insatser av internationell
            karaktär, men jag vill ändå ge uttryck för en önskan. Av de många
            miljarder som kan sparas på försvaret skulle åtminstone några
            miljoner kunna tillföras OSSE, som en välbehövlig förstärkning
            och ett erkännande av de insatser som görs. Det skulle också ligga
            en viss värdefull symbolik i det.

            Jag har inga invändningar mot utskottets förslag att lägga regeringens
            skrivelse om OSSE till handlingarna, men jag vill uppmana alla:
            Läs den gärna först och se vilken spännande och mångsidig organisation
            OSSE är!

            Herr talman! Våren är kommen och därmed kammarens i det närmaste
            årliga vårdebatt om försvarspolitikens långsiktiga inriktning.
            För att apostrofera min företrädare Arne Andersson har vi den
            något märkliga vanan att årligen fatta långsiktiga försvarsbeslut.
            Så skedde vårarna 1995, 1996 och 1997 - den gången som följd av
            de då anmälda bristerna i 10-
          </note>
          <note>
            miljardersklassen. Inte heller förra våren slapp vi undan. Då
            handlade den långsiktiga debatten om behovet av ett nytt försvarsbeslut
            i stället för det av
          </note>
          <note>
            1996 års modell, som hade havererat enligt alla partiers utom
            Centerns och Socialdemokraternas mening.

            Som vanligt sedan det socialdemokratiska maktövertagandet 1994
            börjar även dagens beslut i fel ände av det som borde vara en
            rationell beslutsprocess. 1994 avsattes en 2-miljarders årlig
            besparing med 2 extra miljarder i minne, med brasklappen "om den
            säkerhetspolitiska utvecklingen så tillåter". Försvarsberedningen
            levererade snabbt och villigt en sådan tillåtelse, och den första
            tioprocentiga nedskärningen var ett faktum. Detta skede innan
            någon definierat vad vi behövde, än mindre visste vad pengarna
            skulle räcka till.

            räcka till att substantiella besparingar skulle kunna göras.

            Miljöpartiet och Vänstern. Formellt uppsattes som årligt sparmål

            Samtidigt försvan 1996 och 1998 års enhälliga löften från riksdagen
            när det gällde kompensationen för den likviditetsindragning som
            följde på anslagsförordningens införande. Detta löftesbrott i
            mångmiljardklassen - utöver den årliga nedskärningen i nästa försvarsbeslutsperiod
            - tänker riksdagsmajoriteten i dag driva igenom, kosta vad det
            kosta vill.
          </note>
          <note>
            Den nedskärning som i dag expedieras tycks nämligen få rent orimliga
            konsekvenser, om man skall lita till förra veckans underlag från
            Försvarsmakten. En halvering av flottan och ett avskaffande av
            kustartilleriet kombineras med en armé som är en tredjedel så
            stor som i 1996 års försvarsbeslut. Jag vill inte tro att det
            var regeringens avsikt. Ännu finns tid att kränga sig ur grönvänsterns
            grepp. Att svenskt försvar tagits som gisslan av två - förvisso
            i olika grad men ändock - rent försvarsfientliga partier är djupt
            olyckligt.

            Herr talman! När en del av Europa står i brand och hundratusentals
            européer flyr från sina hem undan etnisk rensning och flygbomber
            minskar Sverige sina ekonomiska satsningar på freden. Det är en
            orimlig prioritering av ett land som under decennier har stått
            och talat för internationell solidaritet. Också utvecklingen i
            närområdet präglas av större osäkerhet i Kosovokrigets spår.

            Anslagen för militära insatser utomlands har minskat kraftigt
            sedan socialdemokraterna tog över regeringsmakten 1994. I början
            av 90-talet satsades närmare en miljard på fredsfrämjande åtgärder,
            under det att årets budget hittills stannar vid 392 miljoner.

            En insatsstyrka av bataljonsstorlek i Kosovo har det hittills
            inte funnits pengar till. Därför är inriktningen fortfarande -
            mot bättre vetande - en halvmesyr tillsammans med Finland. Pengar
            för denna anvisas i tilläggsbudgeten.

            Visst skall vi verka tillsammans med våra nordiska bröder och
            andra grannar runt Östersjön, men för att kunna möta de allvarligaste
            utmaningarna i fredsframtvingande uppdrag krävs gemensamma - inte
            löst sammansatta - förband. Det förslag om en gemensam nordisk
            brigad som Carl Bildt framförde för snart fem år sedan befinner
            sig fortfarande på ritbordet. Varför händer så lite? Varför blir
            regeringens ord så sällan handling också på det här området?

            Om det nu bara handlade om försvaret av Sverige skulle det vara
            en aning lättare att förstå regeringens försvarspolitik. Att det
            traditionella hotet har minskat är obestridligt. De rent militära
            möjligheterna att genomföra en brett upplagd invasion över luft,
            över hav och över gräns ter sig i dag små. Men varje väpnat angrepp,
            oavsett styrka och storlek, som besätter eller utnyttjar en del
            av vårt territorium till lands eller till sjöss är en invasion.
            Varje tänkbart väpnat angrepp, stort eller litet, måste kunna
            mötas med ett realistiskt hopp om att ensamma eller tillsammans
            med andra kunna slå tillbaka angreppet. Och varje kränkning, avsiktlig
            eller oavsiktlig, måste också kunna avvisas.

            Det har åtskilliga gånger hävdats att invasionsförsvaret skall
            avskaffas. Men att invasionsförsvaret förändras får inte förväxlas
            med att vi skulle sluta att försvara Sverige. Det är och förblir
            försvarets viktigaste uppgift.

            rättsstatens grund är ett annat. I detta arbete spelar vår stridskrafter,

            Vår fråga är nu: Hur förmår vi att förändra försvaret från det
            helt hotstyrda till en mer flexibel och allsidig organisation
            som kan så mycket mer än att bara möta en tilltänkt fiende? Detta
            är nyckelfrågan inför det stora försvarsbeslut som avgör försvarets
            utformning för lång tid framöver.

            Militär förmåga spelar roll, oavsett vad vi naiva svenskar tycker,
            i det mellanstatliga umgänget. Det spelar roll också på andra
            politiska områden. Ett aktuellt exempel på att det har betydelse
            är det ursprungligen brittiska förslaget om att inom EU:s ram
            förstärka den europeiska militära krishanteringsförmågan, tillkommet
            på Tony Blairs initiativ. Förslaget har vid sidan av de starka
            sakliga skäl som finns för detta åstadkommit att Storbritannien
            återkommit som en EU-aktör som tas på avsevärt större allvar än
            tidigare. Militär styrka används alltså för att skapa inflytande
            också på andra politiska områden.

            De ökade anspråken på att vi skall delta i internationellt säkerhetssamarbete
            är verkliga. Det räcker inte med besvärjelser. När det gäller
            omformningen av svenskt försvar från enbart försvar till både
            försvar mot väpnade angrepp - med andra ord olika typer av invasion
            - och försvar som militärt instrument för att i bredare bemärkelse
            hävda Sveriges säkerhetsintressen räcker det inte med ord.

            I den verklighet som i förra veckan presenterades i form av Försvarsmaktens
            underlag till det lilla som tycks bli kvar av svenskt försvar

            insatser.

            - prioriteras internationella insatser med flyg- och sjöstridskrafter
            ned, trots att förmågan i dessa finns inbyggd på ett helt annat
            sätt än i arméns nuvarande struktur. Man måste ställa sig frågan:
            Varför? Varför göra denna tydliga klassning i A- och B-lag inom
            det militära försvaret? Erfarenheterna från Balkan har tung säkerhetspolitisk
            bäring, men får inte tillåtas att låsa bilden av vilka förband
            och förbandstyper som kommer att behövas för internationella insatser
            i framtiden. Här behövs ett bredare anslag.

            De utmaningar som framtidens militära instrument måste klara
            av är i många stycken större än under det kalla krigets förutsägbara
            krigsfall. Planeringen och förbandens förmåga kräver långt mer
            av dynamik, förutseende och flexibilitet. Utgångspunkterna för
            våra egna stridskrafter måste vara tillräcklig förmåga att möta
            varje tänkbart hot i dag, samtidigt som vi snabbt kan bygga upp
            vår förmåga att solidariskt bidra i fredsfrämjande insatser. Men
            försvaret måste också ha förmågan att växa sig starkare inbyggd.
            Varför? Jo, därför att fyra brigader försvarar inte Sverige, lika
            lite som tolv ytstridsfartyg eller fem ubåtar gör det. Det val
            som Sverige måste göra är att kombinera förmågan att lösa dagens
            uppgifter - i första hand i närområdet, i andra hand i resten
            av

            Att ÖB:s förslag, oavsett antalet avvikande meningar, är ett
            försök att lösa en omöjlig ekvation står klart. Hur skall ett
            fortsatt stort flygvapen, med allt vad det kräver av beväpning
            och utbildning, kunna rymmas inom de mycket snäva ramar som försvarsministern
            anvisat utan att det drabbar sans och balans i försvaret? Och
            hur skall den vällovliga ambitionen att höja vår internationella
            insatsförmåga kunna bli verklighet när hela försvaret dräneras
            på kraft och kompetens? Vem vet vad som egentligen blir kvar av
            denna förmåga när det hela står klart? Den partiella avrustningen
            är så omfattande att ingen nu kan överblicka dess konsekvenser.
            Man får inte underskatta risken för systemkollaps när osäkerheten
            kring en mängd avgörande faktorer är så grundläggande. Den logiska

            Regementskramare kallades ju förr med rätta de som värnade kaserner
            före krigsförband. I dag, menar jag, finns det anledning att omvärdera
            den militära infrastrukturen. För en liten insatsorganisation
            utformad efter dagens behov krävs en kompetensbärande infrastruktur.
            Ett större antal utbildningsplattformar kopplade till ett litet
            men avsevärt mer aktivt krigsförband - kanske en bataljon/bataljonsstridsgrupp
            - i stället för de storgarnisoner som många drömmer om är ett
            koncept som är värt att pröva.

            Att armén blir mindre är oundvikligt. Men för den dvärgarmé som
            nu skisseras är betydelsen av inneboende växtkraft ännu viktigare
            än förr. För detta krävs långt bättre förutsättningar att sätta
            upp många fler förband i såväl ett ett- som femårsperspektiv.

            Försvaret av svenskt luftrum är fortfarande centralt. Gripen
            spelar här en huvudroll. Antalet flygplan ligger fast i och med
            det kontrakt som staten skrev med IG JAS 1997. Även om Gripen
            blir det sista svenska stridsflygplanet blir flygindustrin en
            nationell tillgång även i framtiden. För att Gripen skall kunna
            möta också framtidens hot krävs den kompetens som industrin i
            dag bistår oss med. Att tro något annat vore verklighetsfrämmande.

            Modernt luftvärn måste till för ett komplett luftförsvar. Den
            förmåga till luftherravälde som jag här har beskrivit är nödvändig
            också för att marin- och markstridskrafter skall komma till verkan.
            I den bemärkelsen menar jag att den pågående försvarsgrensstriden
            är direkt kontraproduktiv.

            De marina förbandens antal får enligt min mening inte underskrida
            den gräns där Sveriges kontroll över och insatsförmåga i Östersjöområdet
            ifrågasätts.

          <note>
            Denna gräns och förmågan att delta i internationella insatser
            med några fartyg i taget måste avgöra volymen. En halvering av
            dagens 24 ytstridsfartyg ter sig i sammanhanget omöjlig för ett
            Sverige som alltid kommer att bära ett förstahandsansvar i Östersjöområdet.

            Med regeringens politik i allmänhet och anslagsnivå i synnerhet
            blir den framtida försvarsstrukturen varken hackad eller malen.
            Effektförlusten vad gäller försvarsförmågan kommer att kosta långt
            mer än vad besparingarna smakar rent statsfinansiellt.

            att tänka till. Är det ett rimligt pris för de fåtaliga miljarder
            som besparingen ger? Är effekterna rimliga? Går det att skapa
            ett försvar i sans och balans på denna ekonomiska nivå och med
            detta tidsperspektiv?

            Till sist, än en gång, den avgörande frågan: Varför nedrusta
            fredsarbetet när Balkan står i brand? Det är inte bara omvärlden
            som undrar.

            Herr talman, ledamöter och få men naggande goda åhörare! Vänsterpartiet
            har sedan många år tillbaka krävt att det militära försvaret skall
            minskas till förmån för andra verksamheter inom vår gemensamma
            sektor.

            USA. Sedan 1985 och fram till 1997 har kostnaderna för försvarsutgifterna
            sjunkit i vår omvärld. Några axplock ur den statistik som vi har
            fått visar att
          </note>
          <note>
            Tyskland har minskat försvarsutgifterna med 38 %,

            lägre nu än före murens fall. Samtidigt har de svenska försvarsutgifterna

            Sverige har haft och har ett starkt försvar. Det är inte riktigt
            den bilden som Henrik Landerholm visar när han talar om det förfärliga
            med att vi skall skära ned på försvaret.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vi ser i stället att vi äntligen har fått en förändring. Beslutet
            om att omdana och minska försvaret hälsas med glädje. Det stora
            invasionshotet har äntligen kunnat avskrivas ur den svenska försvarsplaneringen.
            Även om det försvarsbeslut som fattades 1996
          </note>
          <note>
            hade dessa tendenser gav det inte någon större påverkan på inriktningen
            av försvaret. Men nu tas det första riktiga steget. Genom de förslag
            till nedskärningar av ramarna för år 2002 och tre år framåt med
            totalt 12 miljarder har regeringen gått från ord till handling.
            Vi ser detta som en start för ett försatt förändrings- och nedrustningsarbete,
            även om det blir ett omställningsbidrag under två år.

            Vänsterpartiet ser också positivt på den möjlighet som ges för
            ett utökat deltagande i internationella missioner. Vi har en lång
            tradition på området, och som en neutral och alliansfri stat vet
            jag att vi kan göra mycket i det fredsbefrämjande och fredsbevarande
            arbetet. Vårt krav är dock att de svenska resurserna bara skall
            sättas in när OSSE eller FN begär det och efter det att ett fredsavtal
            undertecknats eller när ett konfliktområde behöver stöd för att
            inleda samtal.

            åtgärder. Det är naturligtvis också viktigt att Sverige deltar
            i humanitära åtgärder och stöder minröjning runtom i vår värld.

            Vi anser alltså att försvarsutskottets betänkande, som nu ligger
            på riksdagens bord, är det första steget mot en ny försvarspolitik.
            Utvecklandet av denna nya inriktning står på fyra ben. Senare
            i höst kommer den fysiska planeringen och de framtida enheternas
            lokalisering och innehåll att kunna diskuteras och beslutas om
            här. Vidare kommer materielfrågan och värnplikten att behandlas
            i höst respektive till våren. Men jag vill redan nu ta upp några
            av dessa frågor.
          </note>
          <note>
            Stig Sandström kommer att redovisa vår ståndpunkt när det gäller
            JAS och annat materiel. Jag skall ta upp hoten mot vårt samhälle
            som kräver uppmärksamhet och medverkan av försvarsresurser.
          </note>
          <note>
            Eftersom de framtida hoten inte primärt är militära måste också
            försvaret vara inriktat mot den nya hotbilden. Riskerna för miljökatastrofer
            och hoten som riktas mot ett alltmer el- och databeroende samhälle
            är realiteter som, om de blir verklighet, starkt skulle kunna
            påverka hela vårt samhälle. Därför är också det civila försvaret
            så viktigt och dess betydelse ökande.
          </note>
          <note>
            Välfärden och demokratin är inte självklara. De kan hotas av
            massarbetslöshet, alltmer ökande orättvisor och segregation. Det
            kan i sin tur leda till stora samhällsproblem med ökat kriminellt
            våld som följd.
          </note>
          <note>
            Lösningarna på dessa problem måste vi söka inom många olika områden
            i vårt samhälle. I det här sammanhanget vill vi också se en allmän
            värnplikt som inte är militär utan civil. Den skulle kunna omfatta
            alla män och kvinnor och vara ett komplement till den militära
            värnplikten. Syftet med denna värnplikt skulle vara att göra samhället
            och dess invånare mer robusta och ge kunskaper som stärker samhällets
            alla delar.

            Dessa frågor kommer vi naturligtvis tillbaka till när Pliktutredningen
            lägger sitt förslag. Därför utvecklar jag inte tankegången närmare,
            men jag tycker att det är viktigt att påpeka dessa synpunkter.

            Herr talman! Stödet till det civila samhället i fred är en viktig
            uppgift för försvaret framgent. Miljöhoten runtom i landet och
            i vår omvärld är stora. Samhället handskas med miljöfarliga varor,
            och transporter sker på land och på vattenvägar med allt större
            tonnage. Även inom industrin är kemikalieanvändandet stort. Det
            viktiga är naturligtvis att minska användandet och därmed behovet
            av transporter av dessa farliga varor, men också att förebygga
            olyckor. Vi har här i riksdagen alldeles nyligen fattat flera
            beslut som handlar om säkrare kemikaliehantering och kontroll,
            men olyckor kan ändå ske.
          </note>
          <note>
            Miljöproblemen har dessutom inga gränser. Ett haveri till sjöss
            eller på en vattenväg kan skada oerhört stora områden. Det påverkar
            samhällets alla delar som vattentäkter, kommunikationer m.m. Vi
            vet också att det finns stora latenta miljöhot i vår omvärld.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det finns dokumenterade behov av sanering, inte minst i våra
            östra grannländer. Därför är miljöpolitik också säkerhetspolitik.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det är därför som vi tycker att det är så oerhört viktigt att
            vi kan utbilda miljösoldater. Det är en mycket viktig fråga för
            framtiden. De kan naturligtvis vara med i internationella missioner
            på sikt. Behovet av att kunna använda militära resurser för miljöändamål
            har varit uppe i Europaparlamentet. Den resolution som antogs
            rekommenderar medlemsstaterna att se vilka resurser som skulle
            kunna ställas till förfogande vid miljökatastrofer. Här finns
            alltså ett definierat behov, och här finns en rekommendation från
          </note>
          <note>
            EU. Det är en kunskap som är efterfrågad och behövd. Vi i Sverige
            bör därför utveckla det här området.
          </note>
          <note>
            I utskottsbehandlingen avfärdades detta förslag med att lagen
            om värnplikt inte medger detta i dagsläget. Man får bara skriva
            in värnpliktiga för
          </note>
          <note>
            Försvarsmaktens eller det civila försvarets behov.
          </note>
          <note>
            Men om samhället har andra behov i dag än tidigare måste ju lagar
            kunna ändras. Därför anser vi att Sverige skall satsa på att utbilda
            miljösoldater i miljöbrigader så att unga människor kan utbildas
            och delta i miljösanering.

            Det allt överskuggande problemet runtom i vår värld är de minor
            som finns nedgrävda. De omöjliggör ett normalt liv. Människor
            tvingas leva i flyktingläger med den misär det innebär och den
            risk det också innebär för nya konflikter. Sverige har som neutral
            stat ett stort ansvar. Vi har också drivit på i den här frågan,
            både vad gäller ratificering av beslutet om förbud mot antipersonella
            minor och satsning på minröjning. Det är mycket bra. Jag håller
            med om att vi ligger långt framme här. Men om de minor som nu
            finns skulle tas bort i den nuvarande takten skulle det dröja
            många hundra år innan alla områden är minfria.
          </note>
          <note>
            Därför behöver vårt arbete med detta mångdubblas och alla krafter
            sättas in. Regeringen säger att frågan är viktig. Då måste också
            mer resurser avdelas till det här viktiga arbetet. Det finns minröjningsresurser
            både inom Sida och Räddningsverket. Deras uppgifter är ju humanitära
            insatser.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vi i Vänsterpartiet har i olika sammanhang yrkat på en utökning
            av resurserna inom de områden som berör minröjning. I dag finns
            det 70 miljoner kronor i
          </note>
          <note>
            Försvarsmaktens budget. För att ge möjlighet att göra ett bättre
            arbete på det här området behövs det åtminstone 200 miljoner per
            år. Vänsterpartiet, Miljöpartiet och Folkpartiet har yrkat på
            en omfördelning i budgeten, men fick inget gehör för detta i utskottet.
          </note>

            Herr talman! Detta betänkande är inledningen på en ominriktning
            av totalförsvaret som kommer att leda till ett nytt försvarsbeslut.
            För att detta arbete skall kunna ge ett trovärdigt resultat är
            det ett livsvillkor för Försvarsmakten att trots avvecklingar
            kunna behålla hög kompetens och vidmakthålla god rekrytering.
            Den kompetens som finns hos personalen i totalförsvaret och försvarsindustrin
            är lättrörlig och många gånger svår att behålla utan långsiktighet
            i planering och utveckling.

            Herr talman! Regeringens inriktning är att den ekonomiska ramen
            fr.o.m. år 2002 skall vara 4 miljarder kronor mindre än den ram
            som godkändes av riksdagen 1998. Den särskilda uppräkningen av
            anslaget för anskaffning av materiel med den s.k. teknikfaktorn
            skall upphöra fr.o.m. år 2000.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det bör noteras att ett omställningsbidrag om totalt 4 miljarder
            kronor skall användas för kostnader som uppkommer i samband med
            strukturförändringarna. Det kommer alltså inte den egentliga verksamheten
            till godo.
          </note>
          <note>
            Förslaget innebär nedskärningar på 12 miljarder kronor. Till
            detta kommer borttagandet av teknikfaktorn, som innebär minskad
            köpkraft med ca 4 miljarder kronor, dvs. en nedskärning med totalt
            ca 16
          </note>
          <note>
            miljarder kronor under perioden 2002-2004. Under återstoden av
            innevarande försvarsbeslutsperiod har dessutom ramen urholkats
            med ca 7 miljarder kronor genom bl.a. anslagsförordningens effekter.
            Under rubriken Ekonomiska ramar skriver regeringen att
          </note>
          <note>
            "Försvarsmaktens anslag vid utgången av år 2001
          </note>
          <note>
            inte skall ha någon kvarstående belastning i form av utnyttjad
            anslagskredit". Detta betyder att Försvarsmakten måste inplanera
            en större reserv än normalt för att kunna täcka in oförutsedda
            händelser.
          </note>
          <note>
            Att på kort tid genomföra en planerad ominriktning och reduktion
            av Försvarsmakten inför ett nytt försvarsbeslut innebär stora
            kostnader. När det gäller de framtida försvarskostnaderna är det
            för tidigt att uttala sig om hur mycket billigare ett sådant försvar
            kan bli. En rad osäkra faktorer finns. Det finns ingen samlad
            syn på hur den framtida personalförsörjningen skall utformas.
            Investeringar i försvarsmateriel är långsiktiga och kontraktsbundna.
            Kostnader för personalavveckling, pliktpersonalens framtida förmåner
            och avveckling av mark, anläggningar och förnödenheter är omfattande
            samtidigt som en förtätning av grundorganisationen kan medföra
            stora investeringar.

            De ekonomiska ramar som föreslås innebär dramatiska nedskärningar
            för försvaret. Kristdemokraterna kan inte medverka till ett sådant
            beslut i ett läge där konsekvenserna inte kan överblickas. Det
            är därför absolut nödvändigt att konsekvenserna för grundoch krigsorganisationen
            under den kommande försvarsbeslutsperioden klargörs i samband
            med att ramarna fastställs. Erfarenheter från tidigare omstruktureringar
            har visat att det är lätt att överskatta besparingspotentialen.
            Kristdemokraterna avstyrker därför regeringens föreslagna inriktning
            till ekonomiska ramar för perioden 2002-2004.

            Fru talman! En viktig förutsättning för kontinuerlig förnyelse
            av den materiel som krävs för att upprätthålla en hög försvarsförmåga
            är att anslagen anpassas till de verkliga kostnadsförändringarna.
            Teknikfaktorn som ingick i 1992 års försvarsbeslut har haft stor
            betydelse för den fortsatta utvecklingen mot ett modernt och allsidigt
            försvar.
          </note>
          <note>
            Regeringen anför att motiv saknas för en generell kostnadsuppräkning
            med teknikfaktorn men tillägger att medel för teknisk förnyelse
            bör reserveras inom fastställda ekonomiska ramar. Kristdemokraterna
            menar att förslaget måste utformas så att inte övriga anslag inom
            fastställd ram urholkas. I reservation 5
          </note>
          <note>

          <note>
            Regeringen konstaterar att anslagsförordningens konsekvenser
            inte är möjliga att följa upp trots att riksdagen vid två tillfällen
            betonat att den skall vara verksamhetsneutral och att regeringen
            i budgetpropositionen 1998 avsåg att utvärdera dess effekter år

            2002. Kristdemokraterna vidhåller sin uppfattning att anslagsförordningens
            köpkraftseffekter snarast bör granskas för att bringa klarhet
            i de akuta försvarsekonomiska problemen. Denna granskning bör
            fungera som underlag när regeringen återkommer till riksdagen
            med förslag till ekonomisk ram och grund- och krigsorganisation.

            Fru talman! Efterfrågan på bidrag till internationella insatser
            varierar. Förutsättningar för att i ökad utsträckning kunna ge
            avsiktsförklaringar, planera för och delta i fredsfrämjande insatser
            är att det finns ekonomiska resurser som kan användas över flera
            budgetår.
          </note>
          <note>
            Kristdemokraterna har tidigare framfört att resurser för fredsfrämjande
            verksamhet inte får urholka totalförsvarets ekonomiska ramar,
            vilket försvarsutskottet då instämde i. Vi vill ha en tydlig och
            fast struktur med öronmärkta pengar för hur svenska internationella
            insatser skall finansieras. Då får vi både en bättre politisk
            handlingsfrihet och försvarsplanering.
          </note>
          <note>
            Eftersom utskottet inte anser detta lämpligt men ändå påpekar
            att det är "angeläget att undvika omavvägningar inom utgiftsområdet
            under pågående verksamhetsår" för vi även fram detta krav i vår
            ekonomiska reservation. Bifall till reservation nr 2!

            Fru talman! Att bidra till fred och säkerhet i omvärlden är en
            av totalförsvarets huvuduppgifter. Det svenska försvaret måste
            därför ha förmåga att förhindra spridning till svenskt territorium
            av eventuella kriser och väpnade konflikter i närområdet. Resurser
            bör avsättas som leder till att Sverige kan avdela förband från
            alla försvarsgrenar till internationella operationer. Ju bättre
            interoperabilitet vi får, desto färre förberedelser inför övningar
            och internationella operationer behöver göras.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vid olika typer av insatser måste vi se till att svensk personal
            i möjligaste mån skyddas för verkningar av såväl konventionella
            vapen som massförstörelsevapen. Det är viktigt att stödfunktionerna,
            t.ex. sjukvårdsförband, har förmåga att uppträda nära och i samma
            insatsmiljö som stridande förband. Förutsättningarna för en väl
            fungerande och förberedd hälso- och sjukvårdsorganisation kräver
            att Försvarets sjukvårdscentrum har resurser som täcker såväl
            förebyggande åtgärder på veterinär- och hälsoskyddssidan som åtgärder
            för att kunna rekrytera och utbilda sjukvårdspersonal för internationella
            insatser.

            Fru talman! Ett bibehållande av Sveriges militära alliansfrihet
            ställer krav på tydlig trovärdighet vad gäller vår försvarsförmåga.
            Försvaret av Sverige är det yttersta motivet för det militära
            försvarets existens. Angrepp skall kunna mötas var de än kommer
            ifrån, och hela landet skall försvaras. En betryggande svensk
            försvarsförmåga bidrar till stabilitet i det nordeuropeiska området.
            Strävan bör vara ett så effektivt utnyttjande som möjligt av de
            samlade resurser som Sverige satsar för att trygga sin säkerhet.

            274 mil lång kust samt att avståndet från den nordligaste platsen
            till den sydligaste platsen är 157 mil.

          <note>
            Minskningen av antalet förband och de neddragningar av beredskapen
            som diskuteras får inte leda till att det blir luckor i våra övervaknings-
            eller insatssystem. En personell och materiell bas för anpassning
            till de försvarsbehov som alltid finns för att hävda nationell
            integritet, stödja samhället och delta i internationella insatser
            måste bibehållas på en trovärdig nivå.

            Utvecklingen inom informations- och ledningsområdena samt inom
            vapen- och ammunitionsområdet går snabbt. Vid utformningen av
            insatsorganisationen måste våra förband bli balanserade när det
            gäller vapenverkan, skydd, underrättelseförmåga, ledning samt
            taktisk och operativ rörlighet. Vid en fredsframtvingande operation
            måste våra förband ha förmåga att genomföra väpnad strid var som
            helst och när som helst. Målsättningen måste vara förband med
            kvalitet över hela linjen.
          </note>
          <note>
            Även om utskottet har erfarit att regeringen för närvarande inte
            avser att vakantsätta vissa förband kräver Kristdemokraterna att
            regeringen dels redovisar vilken beredskapsnivå som krävs för
            att på ett trovärdigt sätt kunna hävda Sveriges nationella integritet,
            dels informerar riksdagen om de beredskapssänkningar och vakantsättningar
            av förband som senare planeras. Vi har utvecklat detta i reservation
            7.

            Fru talman! Den kärna av högt prioriterade insatsförband som
            krävs i den framtida krigsorganisationen måste ha hög kvalitet.
            Dessa kvalificerade stridskrafter skall med hög taktisk och operativ
            rörlighet kunna identifiera och leda bekämpning av mark-, sjö-
            och luftmål. De skall även utgöra grunden för den långsiktiga
            anpassningen genom sin kompetensbas. Tydliga operativa krav måste
            ställas utifrån det militära försvarets fyra huvuduppgifter.
          </note>
          <note>
            Med hänsyn till Sveriges maritima beroende och de krav som redan
            i fred ställs på övervakning och kontroll för att markera svenska
            intressen i Östersjön och västerhavet bör den marina förbandsvolymen
            och beredskapen upprätthållas på en nivå som säkerställer samtidiga
            insatser i Östersjön och västerhavet med ytstridsfartyg, ubåtar
            och minröjningsfartyg. Övervakning och kontroll av våra vidsträckta
            skärgårdsområden, territorialhavet och den ekonomiska zonen skall
            kunna ske kontinuerligt. Kvalitativ förnyelse av de marina förbanden
            måste säkerställas. Därmed kan också en grund skapas för att bevara
            den världsledande position som Sverige för närvarande har avseende
            marina resurser samtidigt som strategiskt viktiga kompetenser
            bevaras inom landet.

            En viktig del av territorialförsvaret är hemvärnet, som genom
            sin förankring har mycket god lokalkännedom. Eftersom hemvärnet
            är en levande organisation som finns över hela landet dygnet om,
            året runt stärker det samhällets förmåga att motstå svåra påfrestningar.
            Kristdemokraterna menar att en utredning borde ha tillsatts för
            att vi skall kunna säkerställa hemvärnets framtida möjligheter
            att agera i både freds- och beredskapssituationer.
          </note>
          <note>
            Fru talman! Eftersom totalförsvaret vid en krissituation i omvärlden
            successivt skall kunna höja beredskapen och även kunna vidta åtgärder
            mot förändrade hot blir anpassningsfilosofin av fortsatt central
            betydelse. Förändringar av hot och risker bedöms kunna ske snabbare
            nu än under det kalla kriget. En inbyggd handlingsfrihet mot nya
            typer av angreppshot gör det nödvändigt att det svenska försvaret
            har en stabil grund. Förnyelse och utveckling kommer att erfordras
            för internationella insatser och för att vi skall kunna följa
            med i den militärtekniska utvecklingen och skapa handlingsfrihet
            för framtiden.
          </note>
          <note>
            Basen för anpassnings- och tillväxtförmågan är en kvalitativt
            utvecklad och kompetent insatsorganisation. Därför måste vi skapa
            största möjliga tilltro till anpassningsprincipen, som visar hur
            vår försvarsförmåga kan höjas. Framför allt måste kedjan från
            tidiga signaler till konkreta åtgärder fungera väl. Om försvaret
            behöver växa får inte startsträckan bli för lång.
          </note>
          <note>
            Kristdemokraterna har därför betonat att riksdagen årligen bör
            få information om anpassningsförmågan, vilket utskottet nu förutsätter.
            Där skall framgå beredskapskraven på insatsorganisationen och
            vilken grad av beredskap som upprätthålls.
          </note>
          <note>
            Erfarenhetsmässigt är det ett omfattade och kostnadskrävande
            arbete att återta eller tillskapa ny kompetens. Eftersom ett förband
            är fullt operativt först när det är samövat till alla sina funktioner
            och uppfyllt med personal, förnödenheter och materiel för strid
            måste befälens kompetens övas och utvecklas.
          </note>
          <note>
            Detta blir än viktigare nu när svenska förband skall kunna delta
            i fredsframtvingande insatser. Vår anpassningsförmåga finns i
            övningsverksamheten, som är helt nödvändig för att behålla och
            inspirera kvalificerad personal.
          </note>
          <note>
            Den nu rådande situationen med en försvarsmakt med låg verksamhetsnivå
            som får allt modernare materiel, men där officerare och värnpliktiga
            får allt sämre möjligheter att lära sig använda ny materiel, är
            ohållbar. Utskottet håller med kristdemokraterna om att det behövs
            en grundläggande och kontinuerlig verksamhet som vidmakthåller
            och utvecklar erforderliga förmågor.
          </note>

            Fru talman! Sveriges militära alliansfrihet förutsätter att vi
            har kapacitet att självständigt försvara vårt territorium. Denna
            förmåga har byggt på en hög materiell försörjningsgrad, vilken
            har utgjort en viktig del av försvarspolitiken. Den svenska försvarsindustrins
            unika förmåga att leverera kvalificerade högteknologiska system
            har därför ett stort försvars- och säkerhetspolitiskt värde.
          </note>
          <note>
            Utskottet håller med kristdemokraterna om att det är väsentligt
            att reduceringen av materielanskaffningen inte får medföra negativa
            konsekvenser för tillväxtförmågan. Detta är även viktigt för att
            svensk försvarsindustri skall betraktas som en attraktiv internationell
            samarbetspartner.
          </note>
          <note>
            Trots den osäkerhet som regeringen har försatt försvarsindustrin
            i måste den få tid för omställningar och förutsättningar för fortsatt
            högteknologisk utveckling. Det förtroende som visas svenska produkter
            runtom i världen kan snabbt gå förlorat genom kortsiktiga eller
            uteblivna politiska beslut. Högteknologisk kompetens är lättflyktig
            men svårfångad.
          </note>
          <note>
            Kristdemokraterna ställer sig därför bakom det krav som finns
            i reservation 12 om en parlamentarisk utredning i syfte att ge
            försvarsindustrin långsiktiga besked om framtida prioriteringar.

            Fru talman! I försvars- och säkerhetspolitiken är det nödvändigt
            med stabilitet och långsiktighet. Att projektera och utveckla
            materiel, att utbilda och bedriva en kontinuerlig verksamhet samtidigt
            som en omfattande omstrukturering förestår ställer nu Försvarsmaktens
            och försvarsindustrins personal inför stora utmaningar. Stora
            nedskärningar i ett skede när
          </note>
          <note>
            Försvarsmaktens ekonomi har utsatts för enorma påfrestningar
            och instabila regler ger ingen trovärdighet åt viljan att utforma
            ett nytt försvar. Viktig kompetens riskerar att gå förlorad, och
            arbetet med ominriktningen försvåras.

            förhandlingarna efter det att smalast möjliga uppgörelse träffats

            1996 års försvarsbeslut var ett hafsverk med blicken riktad bakåt.
            Åtskilliga miljarder har lagts på att behålla anläggningar som
            vi redan då kunde se var helt bortkastade, men också på att utbilda
            åtskilliga tiotusentals värnpliktiga som inte fick någon plats
            i den framtida krigsorganisationen. Det var ett helt oacceptabelt
            ingrepp i den enskildes frihet och integritet.

            Detta bidrog till de stora ekonomiska problem som bara månaderna
            efter försvarsbeslutet 1996 visade sig åvila beslutet. Det bidrog
            också till de stora fortsatta ekonomiska problem som försvaret
            lider av under resten av denna försvarsbeslutsperiod. Regeringsmajoritetens

            innebära att ytterligare miljarder används för att förlänga mycket
            av det försvarspolitiska arvet och att de resurser som behövs
            för materiell förnyelse och för internationella insatser går upp

            Fru talman! Ärade ledamöter! Protokolläsare! Det är mot bakgrund
            av de stora omvärldsförändringarna som vi nu diskuterar regeringens
            proposition och utskottets betänkande om svensk försvarspolitik.

            Det har skett stora förändringar. Under de senaste tio åren har
            vi sett alltifrån att Sovjetunionen har kollapsat till att Warszawapakten
            har upplösts. Och vi har framför allt sett en demokratisering
            i östra Europa och i Centraleuropa. Dessa förändringar har lett
            till att militärutgifterna har minskat dramatiskt både internationellt
            och, framför allt, här i Europa. Under de senaste 10-12 åren har
            militärutgifterna halverats i
          </note>
          <note>
            Europa. Bara när det gäller Ryssland har de minskat med över

            minska sina militära utgifter. De ligger i dag, med undantag för
            1990

            Sveriges förmåga att delta i internationella fredsfrämjande insatser
            i FN-regi, och Miljöpartiet har också pläderat för att vi skall
            vidga hotbilden. Det är inte längre den militära invasionen som
            hotar vår demokrati och vårt land, utan vi upplever en rad nya
            hot. Det handlar om alltifrån sönderrostande atomubåtar i Murmansk
            till miljöförstöring, rysk gränsöverskridande maffiaverksamhet
            och IT-sabotage.

            JAS-flygplan, ubåtar eller stridsvagnar. Det behövs helt andra

            Det senaste halvåret har försvarsministern på punkt efter punkt
            bekräftat att regeringen har kommit fram till samma slutsatser
            som Miljöpartiet. Vi är ense om att vi skall avskriva det militära
            invasionshotet; det finns inte längre. Vi är eniga om att vi skall
            minska de militära utgifterna. Vi är eniga om att vi skall avveckla
            delar av invasionsstrukturen och om att vi skall utveckla förmågan
            när det gäller internationella insatser. Det finns också en enighet
            i synen på de andra icke-militära hoten.

          <note>
            Vi är t.ex. inte ense om synen på EU. Det finns också en viss
            skillnad när det gäller synen på i vilken takt minskningarna skall
            göras och när det gäller prioriteringar av vad som skall finnas
            kvar. Men på viktiga punkter råder det i dag en samsyn mellan
            regeringen och Miljöpartiet, och den samsynen är bra.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det viktigaste är kanske samsynen när det gäller det försvarspolitiska

          </note>
          <note>
            det hörde vi här i kammaren alldeles nyligen - att den fruktansvärda
            tragedin på Balkan tas till intäkt för att de minskningar som
            nu diskuteras borde påverkas negativt. Man tar Milosevic och den
            serbiska nationalistiska regimens vedervärdiga folkfördrivningspolitik,
            mördarpolitik, till intäkt för att vårt försvarspolitiska läge
            skulle vara sämre i dag än det var för några år sedan.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det är fel. Vårt försvarspolitiska läge har inte förändrats av
            tragedin på Balkan. Tvärtom får vi varje dag bekräftat att den
            här regionala konflikten inte sprider sig utanför regionen. Den
            har pågått i tio år, och den är fortfarande kvar i regionen. Det
            finns heller ingenting som tyder på att den här konflikten återigen
            skulle leda till en konfrontation mellan
          </note>
          <note>
            Ryssland och USA. Visserligen håller sig Jeltsin med en viss
            retorik och fördömer i hårda ordalag Natos agerande, men det är
            mer att betrakta som ett tal till den inhemska kritiska opinionen.
            När det gäller praktisk handling har Ryssland nämligen inte agerat
            på något sätt som kan tolkas som en konfrontation mot
          </note>
          <note>
            USA. Det här är och förblir en regional konflikt. Vårt försvarspolitiska

            Jag skulle vilja göra ett par reflexioner över det här betänkandet
            och över regeringens förslag. De finns också uttryckta i Miljöpartiets
            motioner och reservationer, och jag tycker att de kan vara angelägna
            att ta upp här i debatten i kammaren.
          </note>

            Regeringen har kommit överens med Centerpartiet om att från år
            2002 börja minska militärutgifterna.
          </note>
          <note>
            Man kan tycka att det är lite onödigt att vänta ytterligare ett
            par år när det gäller dessa enormt höga militärutgifter. Man har
            då kommit överens om att man skall minska dessa utgifter med 12
            miljarder kronor.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det innebär en minskning av Sveriges militära utgifter med 10
            %. Om man jämför det med omvärlden -
          </note>
          <note>
            det har skett en halvering i Europa - måste det betraktas som
            en ganska blygsam neddragning. Många försöker få det här till
            att handla om oerhörda förändringar, och ÖB brukar tala om en
            halvering. Men det innebär att vi går från att spendera 100 miljoner
            kronor varje dag på det militära försvaret till att vi i stället
            spenderar 90 miljoner kronor varje dag på det militära försvaret.
            Större än så är inte den förändring som Socialdemokraterna och
            Centern har kommit fram till.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det andra som jag skulle vilja ta upp är den diskussion som förs
            om anpassningsförmågan. Många talar om vikten av anpassningsförmåga.
            Man talar enbart om anpassning uppåt, dvs. att vi måste ha en
            beredskap för att återigen kraftigt kunna höja militärutgifterna
            och återta militär kapacitet.
          </note>
          <note>
            Fru talman! Jag tycker att det är en brist i den diskussionen,
            eftersom den mer sannolika utvecklingen är att det blir en fortsatt
            minskning av dessa utgifter i omvärlden. Vi får hela tiden rapporter
            om hur den forna ryska röda armén fortsätter att sönderfalla och
            om hur den militära kapaciteten i Ryssland mer eller mindre har
            upphört att existera.
          </note>
          <note>
            När man i dag säger att det skulle ta minst 10-15
          </note>
          <note>
            år för att fysiskt återskapa en offensiv militär styrka i
          </note>
          <note>
            Ryssland innebär det att tidrymden blir längre för varje dag
            som går. Därför är det mer relevant att tala om vikten av att
            ha en anpassningsförmåga nedåt.
          </note>
          <note>
            Hur förbereder vi oss för ytterligare minskningar av militärutgifterna
            och förändringar i försvaret? Om vi inte har den anpassningsförmågan
            skapar vi problem för oss själva, inte minst i de kommuner som
            kommer att beröras av neddragningar och nedläggningar av regementen.
            Det är viktigt att understryka det.
          </note>
          <note>
            En tredje reflexion som jag skulle vilja göra gäller vikten av
            att utveckla vår kapacitet i fråga om internationell medverkan
            i fredsfrämjande operationer i
          </note>
          <note>
            FN-regi. Regeringen har skrivit så här i sitt förslag:
          </note>
          <note>
            "Sverige skall särskilt bidra till FN med viss specialkompetens
            som är särskilt efterfrågad av FN som t.ex.
          </note>
          <note>
            ledningsfunktioner, civilpoliser, observatörer, ammunitions-
            och minröjning, transporter, logistik samt sjukvård."
          </note>
          <note>
            Det här är en klok hållning som vi i Miljöpartiet håller med
            om, fru talman. Man skall satsa på det som
          </note>
          <note>
            Sverige bevisligen är bra på. Jag har tidigare i dag i debatten
            här i kammaren pekat på vikten av att vi ökar vårt engagemang
            i minröjningen. 100 miljoner landminor runt om i världen skördar
            tiotusentals liv varje år. Med nuvarande minröjningstakt räknar
            man med att det tar upp till tusen år att befria de här människorna
            och dessa länder från det ok som mineringen innebär. Sverige besitter
            i dag en unik kompetens, en unik teknik, när det gäller minröjning.
            Regeringen säger också att det här skall vara en prioriterad del
            av den internationella verksamheten inom försvaret.
          </note>
          <note>
            Men tyvärr skiljer sig ord från handling. I praktiken är det
            nämligen mindre än 2 % av försvarsbudgeten som satsas på minröjning.
            I stället borde våra satsningar stå i proportion dels till att
            vi kanske har den bästa tekniken i det här landet, dels till att
            vi är ett av världens rikaste länder.
          </note>
          <note>
            Slutligen, fru talman, skulle jag vilja ta upp den fjärde punkten,
            vikten av att inrätta en insatsstyrka för nationella och internationella
            miljökatastrofer. En majoritet i riksdagen har ställt sig bakom
            att ett av de mer relevanta hoten är hotet mot miljön där det
            traditionella militära försvaret inte kan skydda oss.
          </note>
          <note>
            I Borås kommun har man tagit fram ett koncept för att utbilda
            människor i att hantera nationella och internationella miljökatastrofer.
            Vi i Miljöpartiet anser att det är en bra verksamhet. Vi ser dagligen
            exempel på var sådana här insatsstyrkor skulle kunna användas
            i FN:s regi, nu senast nere i Serbien i det forna Jugoslavien,
            där en av krigets konsekvenser är enorma oljeläckage och läckage
            från kemiska fabriker som påverkar miljön på Balkan på ett sätt
            som få i dag är medvetna om. Här skulle en internationell insatsenhet
            vara av stort värde. Det har vi också uttryckt i en motion från
            Miljöpartiet.
          </note>
          <note>
            Allra sist, fru talman, skulle jag vilja ställa en fråga till
            Centerpartiet. Uppgörelsen med socialdemokratin innebär att man
            fortsättningsvis lägger stor vikt vid materielinköp. Vi har vapenbeställningar
            på uppemot 80-90 miljarder, vapen som motiveras med ett hot som
            alla säger inte längre finns. Det faktum att vi fortsätter att
            fullfölja t.ex. JAS-projektet får stora konsekvenser för regementena,
            som i ännu högre grad måste läggas ned runt om i kommunerna, och
            det i en snabbare takt än vad som hade behövts.
          </note>
          <note>
            Jag undrar hur Centerpartiets paroll "Låt hela landet leva" överensstämmer
            med ett beslut som lägger tonvikten vid vapen- och materielköp,
            vilket drabbar just kommuner runt om i landet på ett kanske onödigt
            sätt. Detsamma gäller miljöbrigaden. Miljöpartiets motion har
            avstyrkts av också Centerpartiet. Hur rimmar det med Centerns
            försök att profilera sig som varandes miljöengagerat? Det vore
            intressant för oss och för väljarna att få en förklaring på det
            senare.
          </note>
          <note>
            Jag stöder självklart alla Miljöpartiets reservationer, men för
            att vinna tid i kammaren senare yrkar jag bifall endast till reservationerna
            3 och 11.

          </note>
          <note>
            För det första ökar det osäkerheten, accentuerar osäkerheten
            i Rysslands bedömning inför duma- och presidentval. Det kan få
            konsekvenser. Det ökar risken för en om inte rödbrun så åtminstone
            storrysk revanschistisk politisk linje som gör att den tragiska
            dimensionen i rysk såväl inrikes- som utrikespolitik faktiskt
            och tyvärr ökar i sannolikhet.
          </note>
          <note>
            För det andra: Kosovo och situationen på Balkan så som den nu

            framöver, kanske decennier.

            Självklart ställer detta krav på svenskt försvar. Jag är glad
            att Lars Ångström och hans tidigare fullständigt pacifistiska
            parti nu i alla fall är positiva till militära insatser för att
            försvara andra länder. Det är en god början. Likväl ter det sig
            lite paradoxalt att försvaret av Sverige i varje läge skall prioriteras
            ned. Vad Lars
          </note>
          <note>
            Ångström borde ha klart för sig, efter att ha arbetat i försvarsutskottet
            ett år, är att förmågan att agera utomlands med militär styrka
            enbart är den ena sidan av ett och samma mynt, att försvara Sverige.
            Utan militär förmåga, allsidig och flexibel, för försvaret av
            vårt eget land har vi inga som helst förutsättningar att kunna
            delta i internationellt fredsfrämjande arbete.

            När det gäller anpassningsförmågan nedåt har vi övat 1982, 1987,
            1989, 1992 och 1996. Jag tror att vårt militära försvar i den
            bemärkelsen är tämligen välövat. Det behöver inte någon ytterligare
            träning på nedskärningar.

            Fru talman! Jag tror att Henrik Landerholm var lite ouppmärksam
            på mitt ordval. Jag sade inte att kriget och tragedin nere på
            Balkan inte fick några säkerhetspolitiska konsekvenser. Jag sade
            att det inte fick några försvarspolitiska konsekvenser. Det är
            en stor skillnad. Självklart får det säkerhetspolitiska konsekvenser
            bl.a. vad gäller Sveriges medverkan i förhoppningsvis framtida
            FN-uppdrag för att säkra en fred. Men när det gäller försvarspolitiska

            Visst har Henrik Landerholm rätt när det gäller osäkerheten i
            Ryssland. Den har vi hela tiden. Det är en stapplande utvecklande
            demokrati med ett stort mått av osäkerhet. Samtidigt finns det
            ingen militär invasionskapacitet kvar i Ryssland. Vi ser hur den
            ryska krigsmakten fortsätter att sönderfalla. Visst kan man varna
            för eventuella rödbruna allianser och framtida val, peka på osäkerheten
            och skrämma människor. Samtidigt vet även den mest rödbruna politikern
            att den dag man börjar rusta mot omvärlden -

            Fru talman! Henrik Landerholm förvånas också över hur vi prioriterar
            ned det svenska försvaret, medan vi är angelägna om att Sverige
            skall kunna delta i internationella FN-uppdrag. Det finns inte
            längre något militärt hot mot Sverige som motiverar ett invasionsförsvar
            för 100 miljoner kronor om dagen. Då är den självklara slutsatsen
            att man prioriterar ned där. De pengar som vi satsat där behövs
            på andra områden i vårt samhälle - sjukvård, skola, barnomsorg.
            Det är bara att gå ut i kommunerna och se. Också Sverige måste
            kunna frigöra militära resurser för angelägnare områden. Samtidigt
            är det också ett faktum att vi behöver ett starkare och bättre
            FN som förhoppningsvis kan agera förebyggande och föregripande.
            Det är självklart att också Sverige skall delta i det.

            En försvarspolitisk konsekvens, Lars Ångström, torde väl också
            vara en långvarig svensk truppnärvaro på Balkan. Det kräver ett
            starkt svenskt samlat försvar, där den internationella verksamheten
            bara är den ena sidan på ett och samma mynt och myntet en allsidig
            och flexibel försvarsförmåga som kan användas såväl här hemma
            som där borta.

            Det här är två sidor av samma sak, som inte går att bortse från.
            Det går inte att propagera för en kraftig nedrustning här hemma
            och samtidigt kräva trovärdighet när det gäller stödet till insatser
            utanför vårt land.

            Fru talman! Det är helt klart att det är skillnad på rätten till
            nationellt försvar, om nu Ryssland skall försöka sopa ihop något
            av de rester som fortfarande finns kvar, och att utveckla en offensiv

            Jag håller inte med Henrik Landerholm i hans bedömning att insatserna
            att stå till FN:s förfogande med 450-500 man i Balkan efter eldupphör,
            med möjliga minröjningsinsatser, med skydd för livsmedelstransporter
            och andra humanitära åtgärder, skulle förutsätta att Sverige fortsätter
            att hålla sig med ett militärt invasionsförsvar för 100 miljoner
            kronor om dygnet. Det tycks mig som om moderaterna krampaktigt
            biter sig fast i alla möjliga argument som går att hitta för att
            bibehålla något som har funnits tidigare och som motiveras med
            någonting som inte längre finns. Det är lite tragiskt.

            Sveriges försvar skall inte längre stå kvar vid det kalla krigets
            struktur, som byggdes upp för att möta en stormaktsinvasion från
            öst. Vi skall förändra och omstrukturera försvaret för att möta
            2000-talets hot och risker. Omstruktureringen blir den största
            i modern tid. Det är ingen enkel process, men den är absolut nödvändig.

            Nu är det rätt tid att genomföra ominriktningen mot ett modernt

            Det betänkande som vi behandlar i dag handlar därför inte i första
            hand om ekonomi, även om det inte sällan framställs som om försvarspolitik
            bara är försvarsekonomi. Därför är det bra att överbefälhavaren
            så tydligt deklarerat att vi inte på något sätt står inför att
            halvera försvarets förmåga. Det viktiga är förmågan, vad vi kan
            få ut av de satsade miljarderna, inte organisationsstrukturen.

            När ÖB den 19 maj presenterade sitt förslag till försvarsstruktur
            skrev han också följande: "Det försvar, om än kraftigt reducerat,
            som finns kvar efter omstruktureringen kommer att innehålla en
            hög personell och materiell kvalitet, en materiell förnyelse och

            "slakten", "massaker", "motorsågsmassaker" och andra begränsat

          <note>
            Om de ca 44 miljarder kronor vi i dag lägger ned på försvaret
            används för investeringar för att möta hot som inte finns, innebär
            det naturligtvis inte på något sätt större trygghet och säkerhet
            för medborgarna än om 40 miljarder kronor används för satsningar
            som är anpassade till dagens verklighet.

            Dessutom är det inte oviktigt att understryka att i fast prisvärde
            är Sveriges försvarsutgifter i dag lika stora som under kalla
            krigets kallaste dagar. Årtionden av rubriker om nedskärningar
            inom försvaret, nedläggningar av förband och ständigt återkommande
            kriser har förmedlat bilden av att landets försvar i stort sett
            är nedlagt. Det finns säkert politiska och andra motiv för att
            beskriva verkligheten på detta sätt, men sanningen är en helt
            annan.

            Fru talman! Den säkerhetspolitiska situationen påverkas redan
            i dag, och än mer i framtiden, inte enbart av nationalstaters
            agerande, utan i allt större utsträckning av andra aktörer. Det
            rör sig om det mesta inom skalan från multinationella företag
            med större ekonomisk styrka än de flesta nationalstater över hela
            spektrumet till kriminella organisationer.

            Utvecklingen av teknik har fört med sig att staters maktmonopol

            möta detta måste bli att det svenska försvaret så snart som möjligt
            sätter upp avancerade IT-

            Det är värt att notera att riksdagens samtliga sju partier står

            för den kommande tioårsperioden:
          </note>
          <note>
            1. Väpnat angrepp med annat syfte än ockupation.
          </note>
          <note>
            T.ex. fjärrstridskrafter som kryssningsmissiler som kan utgå
            direkt från fredsgruppering.
          </note>
          <note>
            2. Angrepp av förtäckt typ. Angriparen, som kan vara såväl en
            stat som en organisation, är svår att identifiera. Nya typer av
            påverkansmedel används, t.ex. angrepp mot infrastrukturen.
          </note>
          <note>
            3. Aktörer som inte är stater men som utnyttjar avancerade vapen.
          </note>
          <note>
            4. Svåra påfrestningar på samhället, där tidsförhållanden är
            knappa och totalförsvarets resurser behöver utnyttjas.

            Försvarsberedningen, regeringen och majoriteten i riksdagens

            möta detta breda spektrum av nya hotbilder.

            - det vi i allmänt tal kallar totalförsvaret - måste kunna tillvaratas
            i ökad utsträckning också på mycket låga konfliktnivåer. Därför
            är det bra att det nu snabbt blir en översyn av lagstiftningen
            och att regeringen snarast återkommer med förslag till förändringar.

            Fru talman! Morgondagens försvar är en kompetensorganisation
            som kan genomföra olika omedelbara insatser, men som också har
            en inbyggd förmåga till ominriktning, till långsiktig anpassning.
            Det behövs ett antal högt prioriterade, kompetenta och mångsidigt
            användbara förband, som dock är avsevärt färre än de vi har i
            dag. Det innebär att vi kommer att lägga ned många av de förbandstyper
            som enbart har uppgifter att möta ett större invasionsföretag
            eller som av andra skäl inte är relevanta mot de hotbilder vi
            ser framför oss.
          </note>
          <note>
            I det fortsatta beredningsarbetet, som bl.a. kommer att ske i
            Försvarsberedningen, är det dock oerhört viktigt att vi förmår
            skapa en riktig avvägning mellan de resurser som vi satsar på
            det vi vill kunna i nutid och de resurser som skall avsättas för
            att säkerställa långsiktig kompetens och förmåga till förändringar.

            Fru talman! Det finns en stark majoritet i riksdagen för att
            minska försvarsutgifterna. Uppgörelsen mellan Centerpartiet och
            Socialdemokraterna innebär att ramen sänks med 4 miljarder från
            år 2002, vilket motsvarar ca 10 %. För att underlätta ominriktningen
            och effekterna av olika avvecklingar, kommer Försvarsmakten att
            få ett särskilt omställningsbidrag på totalt 5 miljarder kronor.
          </note>
          <note>
            Folkpartiet anslår samma ram, men vill ha 1 miljard kronor extra
            i omställningsbidrag för år 2002.
          </note>
          <note>
            Skillnaden mellan Socialdemokraterna och Centern och Folkpartiet
            för det ekonomiska anslaget det året ligger i storleksordningen
            2 %. Till drygt 98 % har vi även detta år samma ekonomiska ram.
            Det är en värdefull enighet. Mellan de tre partierna råder det
            också en stor samsyn kring inriktningen av framtidens försvar,
            vilket Runar Patrikssons anförande var ett starkt uttryck för.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det nya försvaret behöver färre värnpliktiga, färre anställda
            och mindre materiel. Allt detta för med sig att ett stort antal
            regementen och andra verksamheter kommer att läggas ned. Utbildningen
            av totalförsvarspliktiga skall endast utgå från det behov som
            krävs för att lösa uppgiften.
          </note>
          <note>
            När vi lämnar invasionsförsvaret bakom oss innebär det att Försvarsmaktens
            behov inriktas mot mer tekniskt avancerad materiel och bort från
            stora kvantiteter och serieproduktion. Därför bör vi överföra
            medel från produktionskostnader till forskning och teknisk utveckling.
            Dessutom bör ökad vikt läggas vid att sammanlänka civil forskning,
            teknik och utveckling till totalförsvarets behov. Det senaste
            årtiondet har civil och kommersiellt driven forskning fått allt
            större betydelse även för det militära försvaret, vilket måste
            få konsekvenser för materielanskaffningen.
          </note>
          <note>
            Fru talman! I tider av näraliggande oro saknas av lätt insedda
            skäl förmågan att vidta förändringar i strukturer som inte längre
            är relevanta. Då klamrar man sig fast vid det man har. Därför
            skall vi nu genomföra de nödvändiga satsningar som ger landet
            ett starkt och effektivt försvar även i nästa århundrade.

            Fru talman! Det svenska försvaret står inför stora strukturella

            läge successivt förbättrats.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det sker ständigt förändringar i hur länder i vår omvärld agerar
            för att tillgodose säkerheten. Också de militära resurserna förändras,
            liksom den militärtekniska utvecklingen och de militära doktrinerna
            i Europa.
          </note>
          <note>
            Med andra ord: sammantaget betyder detta att vi nu förändrar,
            förnyar och moderniserar vårt svenska försvar. Det är något som
            de flesta inser och håller med mig om. Omdaningen av försvaret
            har sin utgångspunkt i Försvarsberedningens arbete. Vi bygger
            upp ett modernt och rörligt försvar, anpassat till dagens verklighet
            och med förmåga till anpassning för framtida behov i form av ominriktning
            eller tillväxt.

            Det är ett framtidsinriktat försvar, där vi har möjlighet att

            Sverige måste det svenska försvaret förnyas och ställas om, så
            att vi fullt ut kan delta i den internationella krishanteringen.
            Kriget i Kosovo visar att Europas säkerhetspolitiska läge som
            helhet inte är lika bra som det är för Sverige. Jag vill påstå
            att kriget i Kosovo inte har medfört en ökad risk för vare sig
            en invasion i traditionell mening eller ett väpnat angrepp, som
            det står beskrivet i regeringens proposition till riksdagen, under
            förutsättning att vi har en grundläggande försvarsförmåga.
          </note>
          <note>
            Med en utveckling som blivit så befäst är det självklart att
            vi skall genomföra en omstrukturering samtidigt som vi kan sänka
            kostnaderna för försvaret.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det kommer att ta tid att anpassa försvaret till nya uppgifter
            och villkor. En anpassning av den förestående storleken medför
            kostnader, och därför tillför vi ett omställningsbidrag om 5 miljarder
            kronor.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det finns också, mot samma bakgrund, all anledning att genomföra
            en förnyelse av materielförsörjningen. Vi måste bort från det
            som har varit vårt signum under flera decennier - långa serier
            och stora kvantiteter - och vi måste i stället satsa mer på forskning
            och teknikutveckling. Till detta kommer behovet av omstrukturering
            av den europeiska försvarsindustrin. Vi vet att det i dag finns
            en överkapacitet på produktionssidan i Europa. Sammantaget måste
            försvarsindustrin konsolidera sig och möta de behov som finns
            i framtiden, detta med ett bibehållande av hög teknisk kompetens.

            En fortlöpande säkerhetspolitisk analys är en viktig del i det
            nya försvaret. I propositionen pekade regeringen på att det finns
            ett behov av att förbättra förmågan till analys och se över arbetsformerna,
            och det arbetet pågår inom Regeringskansliet. Vi kommer att genom
            Försvarsberedningens arbete analysera tänkbara utvecklingar i
            vår omvärld och därefter på ett logiskt och metodiskt sätt vidareutveckla
            försvaret mot vad som nu behövs. Det innebär att vi får möjlighet
            att utveckla nya förbandstyper och att tillföra nya kunskaper
            och materiel som motsvarar dessa krav. Det skapar förutsättningar
            att möta även andra kriser än dagens. Vi skapar ett instrument
            för att ständigt utveckla vår förmåga att möta framtida hot och
            risker.

            Fru talman! Socialdemokraterna och Centern har tillsammans, genom
            sin uppgörelse om försvaret, visat att våra båda partier vill
            och kan ta ansvar för den framtida utformningen av försvaret.
            Vi har också visat att vi är villiga att ta ett ansvar för de
            omfattande förändringar som detta medför.

          <note>
            Övriga partier, som säger sig vara försvarsvänner, gör det inte.
            Min uppfattning är att både Moderaterna och Kristdemokraterna
            delar många av våra tankar kring behovet av förändringen av försvaret.
            Men icke förty har de valt att ställa sig vid sidan när det gäller
            att genomföra dessa beslut. Trovärdigheten i Kristdemokraternas
            försvarspolitik undermineras dessutom genom att de lovar lite
            mer och lite för ofta vid olika tillfällen.

            Fru talman! Hur den säkerhetspolitiska utvecklingen i Europa
            blir på mycket lång sikt är omöjligt att helt säkert förutspå.
            Vägen från diktatur till demokrati är lång och svår. Men min övertygelse
            är att ett alltmer djupgående samarbete mellan demokratiska länder
            kommer att vara vägen mot ett allt säkrare

            Europa. Som medlemmar i det internationella samfundet har vi
            en skyldighet att agera både preventivt och efter det att en konflikt
            blossat upp. Kraven att vi skall kunna agera i militära krishanteringsoperationer
            på uppdrag av FN eller OSSE kommer att finnas kvar. Detta ansvar
            har vi tillsammans med alla stater inom Förenta nationerna. Jag
            som socialdemokratisk försvarsminister har till uppgift att skapa
            förutsättningarna för att vi skall kunna ta detta ansvar. Genom
            att vi stöttar och uppmuntrar de unga demokratierna kan vi också
            säkerställa en positiv utveckling i världen.

            Det moderna svenska försvaret måste kunna skydda landet och dess
            medborgare mot väpnade konflikter och krig. Även om invasionsföretag
            av det kalla krigets karaktär ter sig orealistiska kan vi likväl
            bli utsatta för hot, påtryckningar eller skadegörelse med militära
            eller andra medel.

            Jag vill i detta sammanhang också beröra vikten av vårt pliktförsvar.
            I dessa dagar hör vi röster som säger att yrkesarmén nu är under
            införande och att den folkliga förankringen sakta tynar bort.
            Min bestämda uppfattning är att det inte är så och inte heller
            kommer att bli så. En socialdemokratisk regering kommer inte att
            införa ett försvar som bemannas av yrkessoldater. Vi kommer aldrig
            att offra folkförsvarstanken.

            Fru talman! En fråga som alltid har varit svår att besvara i
            försvarsplaneringen är varför det behövs ett visst antal arméförband,
            fartygsförband och flygdivisioner för att klara försvarets uppgifter.
            Orsakskedjan har tidigare varit för lång och komplicerad för att
            kunna ge en tillfredsställande förklaring. Försvarsmakten har
            under våren presenterat en modell som kortfattat går ut på att
            bättre förklara sambandet mellan de uppgifter som riksdagen och
            regeringen fastställt och de krigsförband som skall organiseras.

            Jag anser att det är en väsentlig förändring: Dels ger den de
            folkvalda en möjlighet att relatera de övergripande försvarspolitiska
            målen till vårt totalförsvars strukturer och resurser och vid
            behov genomföra förändringar. Dels blir det lättare att relatera
            kostnader till specifika strukturer och resurser.

          <note>
            Denna koppling mellan säkerhetspolitiska krav och verkliga behov
            av förband ger en tydligare bild av vilka förbandstyper som krävs
            och inte minst vilka förbandstyper som inte lever upp till kraven.
            Det ger oss beslutsfattare en tydligare bild. Att bevara strukturer
            som var effektiva i går, men som inte svarar upp mot behoven i
            framtiden, är en felaktig politik. Jag menar att det är vår skyldighet
            att agera så att förbandstyper som inte lever upp till de säkerhetspolitiska
            kraven skall läggas ned. Försvarsmakten har genom sitt studiearbete
            givit oss kunskapen om dessa samband. Nu är det vår skyldighet
            att ta detta på allvar och därmed ta vårt ansvar.

            Vetskapen om att det tar mycket lång tid att bygga upp försvarskapacitet

            hot och risker orsakade av allt från svåra påfrestningar i fred
            till väpnade angrepp. Våra resurser måste samordnas så att vi
            får en bättre krishanteringsförmåga.

            den fortsatta omdaningen kommer regeringen att ta initiativ till
            flera viktiga utredningar. Utredningarnas uppdrag är att se över
            ledningssystemet, det civila försvarets organisation, personalförsörjningen

            den dominerande arbetsgivaren. Staten kommer på de platser där
            det är regionalpolitiskt motiverat att göra sitt yttersta för

            Jag är övertygad om att försvaret kommer att gå stärkt ur denna

            och en ny inriktning av försvarspolitiken. Politik är att ta ansvar,

            Mitt parti deltog med liv och lust i de försvarsförhandlingar

            Jag skulle vilja ställa en fråga till Björn von Sydow. Den handlar
            om förra veckans underlag. Under lång tid har vi fört diskussionen
            om besparingen på försvaret med förutsättningen att vi faktiskt
            inte visste vad den skulle innebära.

            Sveriges förmåga och minskar våra möjligheter att fullt ut delta
            på många av de områden som ligger försvarsministern varmt om hjärtat.
            Det handlar om det försvarsindustriella europeiska samarbetet.
            Det handlar om förutsättningarna att delta i krishantering, där
            underlaget halverar ambitionsförmågan.

            Fru talman! När vi hade våra betydelsefulla förhandlingar var
            det ett viktigt krav från moderaterna som jag är glad att vi kunde
            tillfredsställa. Vi ville se hur konsekvenserna skulle bli av
            en ekonomi av det slag som vi genom Försvarsberedningens tidigare
            ställningstagande var inne på. Vi fick då se ungefär vilka typer
            av förband, vilka stridskrafter, som Sverige behöver, givet omgivningen,
            prognoser framåt och anpassningsmöjligheterna.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det var intressant, men vi var mycket tydliga på den punkten
            att det icke är vi som i den korta perioden skall genomföra detta
            stora studiearbete. Det har nu genomförts av Högkvarteret. Där
            framträder en intressant bild av vad det är för stridskrafter
            som behövs för ett försvar som har en defensiv strategi som sin
            huvuduppgift, att naturligtvis i första hand avskräcka från varje
            form av väpnat angrepp och därtill kunna vistas långvarigt i fält
            i främmande krishärdar. Det är det materialet vi har fått. Dess
            principiella inriktning är betydelsefull och vartenda förband
            som vi har i dag skall vägas mot vilka behov de kan fylla.
          </note>
          <note>
            Nu skall vi granska detta. Jag utgår från att det finns möjligheter
            att komma fram till några justeringar, men principen är ett genombrott
            för en rationell tillämpning av behovet av stridskrafter för en
            defensiv försvars- och säkerhetspolitik i det Nordeuropa där vi
            är och där vi har möjligheter att förutse de kommande åren.

            I Dagens Nyheter för en vecka sedan framställde försvarsministern

            tillåter mig att tvivla på att de fyra brigader som är resultatet

            Försvarsministern och jag är fullständigt överens om att det
            krävs en omstrukturering av det svenska försvaret. Alla är medvetna
            om att det krävs ingrepp, det krävs förändringar och det krävs
            även förnyelse.

            Problemet är att omstrukturering under den knapphetens kalla

            Att genomföra denna omstrukturering samtidigt som man minskar
            kostnaderna är i det närmaste omöjligt, det är att ta sig vatten
            över huvudet. Den plan som ÖB redovisade förra veckan är ett mycket
            tydligt exempel på detta. Med sex avvikande meningar är det en
            omöjlig ekvation som ÖB har haft att lösa inom de av försvarsministern
            tilldelade ramarna. Det är också därför som resultatet har blivit
            som det har blivit.

            dit Henrik Landerholm och Kristdemokraterna är hjärtligt varmt
            välkomna för att vara med och ånyo penetrera den metod som överbefälhavaren
            har valt när han undersöker vad det behövs för förband, och att
            studera den försvarspolitiska utvecklingen och den anpassningsprincip
            som vi går in för, och som jag till min glädje noterar att försvarsutskottet
            anser är väl framställd och begriplig i propositionen. Den prövningen
            skall vi göra här i kammaren, inte i dag utan successivt under

            ligger till grund för denna bedömning, och det är en riktig principiell
            utgångspunkt. Den är också möjlig att hantera med olika ekonomiska
            ingångsvärden, om det säkerhetspolitiska förloppet blir sådant
            att det är behövligt.

            det berodde naturligtvis på att närstridsproblematiken och de

            Problemet var ju då att konsekvenserna inte kunde överblickas.
            Det var därför som jag sade i mitt anförande att det var viktigt
            att se konsekvenserna i förhållande till den ram som sedan blev
            resultatet av denna uppgörelse. Det finns ett stort antal osäkra
            faktorer.

            Om försvarsministern läser de kristdemokratiska reservationerna
            finner han att de inte innehåller några stora satsningar på nya
            förband eller någon stor tillväxtförmåga. Vi vill föra fram t.ex.
            beredskapen som vi anser blir alltför låg nu.

            Jag vill ställa en fråga om de tvära ekonomiska kast som har
            försatt försvarsindustrin i en akut situation. Vad beror det på
            att regeringen inte har kunnat ge besked till försvarsindustrin
            i det här läget? Jag är helt medveten om att det kommer att bli
            en omstrukturering i Europa, men att inte ge besked - vare sig
            positivt eller negativt - försätter ju försvarsindustrin i en
            mycket prekär situation.

            Jag är glad över att Åke Carnerö tar upp frågan om försvarsindustrin.
            Jag har agerat med en utgångspunkt från december: Se till att
            så maximalt många ställningstaganden som över huvud taget går
            sker i samband med det att ÖB den 15 juni överlämnar sina förslag.
            Då har han möjlighet att väga vartenda materielsystem som ligger
            i förhållande till det behov av stridskrafter som han presenterade
            för någon vecka sedan och som vi - som det tidigare replikskiftet
            visade på - givetvis skall gå igenom. Så många ställningstaganden
            som över huvud taget är möjligt skall avvägas i en samlad process
            av chefen för Försvarsmakten, av regeringen och därefter - i förekommande
            fall - av riksdagen.
          </note>
          <note>
            Så har jag agerat, och det visade sig att det var ytterligt få
            projekt som var så tidskritiska att de absolut skulle släppas
            fram före den 15 juni. Men i några fall har argumenten varit så
            starka att regeringen har gett olika former av medgivanden för
            att man skulle kunna gå vidare.

            Fru talman! Jag tackar för det svaret. Men problemet är ju att
            om man inte får ett besked ger detta en signal till eventuella
            beställare. Att då hålla på att projektera och inte veta om svenskt
            försvar kommer att köpa en speciell materiel, t.ex. Bamse, blir
            en signal till utlandet om att man får avvakta. Det innebär att
            kompetens försvinner, vilket leder till en mycket prekär situation,
            och att klarhet därför bör ges så tidigt som möjligt.

            Det stora problem som vi kristdemokrater ser är hur man skall
            kunna bibehålla och utveckla den kompetens som man måste ha för
            att kunna ha en god anpassningsförmåga i framtiden. Vi kan diskutera
            hur stor eller hur bred denna bas skall vara, men problemet i
            dag är att verksamhetsnivån är mycket låg och det är en följd
            av tidigare besparingar. Det är just verksamhetsnivån och kompetensen
            som skall övas hela tiden för att vi skall kunna utgå från denna

            utbildnings- och övningsverksamhet. Ånyo vill jag inte göra några

            lämnade i förra veckan. Men jag kan gärna säga att jag ser positivt
            på att överbefälhavaren lägger stor tonvikt vid utbildning och
            övning av förband på höga nivåer varje år. Genom det liggande
            förslaget kommer det att vara möjligt att redan 2001 komma i gång
            med den typen av övningar på brigadnivå - som sagt, detta utan
            att föregå den fortsatta processen.

            När det gäller försvarsindustrin och den kompetens som finns
            där har jag verkligen lyssnat på argumenten från berörd industri
            om kompetensförluster etc. Jag är klar över att sådana risker
            kan finnas. Jag har vägt in dem, men jag har funnit att de inte
            har varit så pass övertygande så här långt att de har föranlett
            mig att gå ifrån det principiellt riktiga i att få alla materielbeställningar
            och system ställda mot varandra för att därigenom få fram en så
            djupgående prioritering som möjligt.

            Fru talman! Dagens debatt handlar om de grundstenar som skall
            bära upp ett nytt och för sina uppgifter bättre anpassat totalförsvar.
            Ominriktning må vara ett krångligt ord, men det är faktiskt vad
            som kännetecknar det som nu sker på försvarsområdet. Vi står vid
            ett vägval. För mig som historiker är det naturligt att jämföra
            denna ominriktning med några tidigare vägval. Låt mig ta några

            att man med rätta kan kalla det kommande försvarsbeslutet för

            Fru talman! Grundvalen för Sveriges försvarsstruktur måste alltid

            Som flera talare sagt förut i denna debatt har det säkerhetspolitiska
            läget i Europa generellt sett förbättrats kontinuerligt efter
            det kalla krigets slut och bildandet av EU. Detta har också slagits
            fast av en, i det avseendet, enig försvarsberedning.

            Denna generella bild störs givetvis av den pågående konflikten

            bedömningen att den säkerhetspolitiska situationen avsevärt förbättrats.

            Det som händer i Kosovo snarare bekräftar Försvarsberedningens

            för s.k. regionala krig har ökat. I det sammanhanget bör det naturligtvis
            noteras att det inte anses finnas något militärt hot mot vår del
            av Europa.

            Under de närmaste tio åren är ett invasionsföretag syftande till

            att Sverige har en grundläggande försvarsförmåga. Vi kan dock
            inte helt avskriva väpnade angrepp mot begränsade mål i Sverige.

            Två typer av hot har fått ökad aktualitet. Det ena handlar om
            hoten från kärnvapen och från biologiska och kemiska vapen. Riskerna
            har ökat för att andra aktörer än stater, t.ex. terrorister, kan
            producera eller komma över dessa vapen. Det sänker på ett dramatiskt
            sätt tröskeln för dessa vapens användning.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det andra hotet är informationskrigföring. Vårt datoriserade

            Man hävdar att vi inte kan veta hur det är i Europa och fem eller
            tio år, vilket i och för sig är sant. Man jämför ofta med situationen
            före första och andra världskriget och påvisar att den tidens
            politiker inte beaktade signalerna och heller inte vidtog upprustningsåtgärder
            i tid. Med andra ord skulle anpassningskonceptet inte ha någon
            trovärdighet enligt kritikerna.

            Som historiker har jag stor respekt för den kritiken. Jag vill
            t.o.m. bekräfta den vad avser det historiska skeendet, så var
            det. Men betyder det att detta historiska betraktelsesätt är relevant
            i vår tid? Jag tror inte det. I dag har vi på ett helt annat sätt
            tillgång till information och underrättelser. IT och mediesamhället
            har inneburit att ingen nation kan förbereda en aggressiv utrikespolitik
            i lönndom.

            I vårt geopolitiska närområde har de tidigare totalitära systemen
            ersatts av en gryende demokrati, vilket i sig är ett avgörande
            hinder för krig. Första världskriget utkämpades mellan delvis
            totalitära, eller i varje fall odemokratiska, kejsardömen och
            monarkier. Andra världskriget var en kamp mellan fascistiska diktaturer
            och västerländsk demokrati och humanism.

            Nej, den historiska parallellen håller inte vid en intellektuell
            analys. Det faktum att det pågår en militär konflikt i Europa

          <note>
            Det finns givetvis också en risk för att en regional konflikt
            kan spridas geografiskt och trappas upp. I det sammanhanget måste
            det slås fast att det ankommer på den permanenta försvarsberedningen
            att på ett ansvarsfullt sätt följa utvecklingen på Balkan och
            i vårt omedelbara närområde och förutsättningslöst göra de säkerhetspolitiska
            bedömningar som situationen kräver.

            Skulle man vid en sådan analys finna att den säkerhetspolitiska
            situationen avsevärt försämrats sedan bedömningen i vintras måste
            man givetvis överväga att återföra resurser till försvaret. Detta
            är ett trovärdighetskrav för den s.k. anpassningsdoktrinen, men
            också ett trovärdighetskrav på oss försvars- och säkerhetspolitiker.

            Fru talman! Det är i detta sammanhang också viktigt att notera
            att överbefälhavaren i grunden har samma uppfattning - dvs. givet
            att den säkerhetspolitiska analysen är riktig får vi ett mycket
            bra försvar för de resurser som regeringen och förhoppningsvis
            även riksdagen är beredda att anvisa för den kommande försvarsbeslutsperioden.
          </note>
          <note>
            Överbefälhavaren hävdar vidare att vi i modern tid inte haft
            ett bättre tillfälle att omstrukturera eller ominrikta försvaret
            till de krav som kommer att ställas på våra väpnade styrkor det
            kommande århundradet. Det må gälla IT-hot, långräckviddiga vapen,
            skydd av infrastruktur, rörlighet över stora ytor och inte minst
            vår förmåga att uppträda i internationella sammanhang i samverkan
            med andra nationer.

            Det blir rent utav gåtfullt när man läser Alf Svenssons pressmeddelande

            Fru talman! Eftersom det i princip råder enighet om vad försvaret
            skall kunna göra är det också beklagligt att vi inte kunnat nå
            en bredare enighet om de ekonomiska ramarna. Men när man nu ser
            de ekonomiska alternativen från i varje fall Folkpartiet och
          </note>
          <note>
            Kristdemokraterna börjar man undra om det verkligen är ekonomin
            som spökar.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det kanske är så att taktiken förbjuder varje samarbete med regeringen.
            Nu visar det sig att Folkpartiet och Kristdemokraterna har 1 miljard
            mer än Centern och Socialdemokraterna för år 1 av den nya försvarsbeslutsperioden.
            Det är 1 miljard kronor mer i en försvarsram på drygt 40 miljarder
            kronor per år. Man skall inte kalla 1 miljard för nålpengar. Det
            kanske mer verkar vara symbolpengar. Jag skulle gärna vilja fråga
            Runar Patriksson och Åke Carnerö hur man vill använda den extra
            miljarden.
          </note>
          <note>
            Jag måste också i sista minuten svara på den direkta fråga som
            Lars Ångström ställde till Centern och till mig beträffande andelen
            försvarsmateriel, och bl.a. JAS-systemet. För det första är det
            kanske lite tidigt att kommentera försvarsmaterieldelen. Som vi
            har hört tidigare kommer ÖB med en materielplan i juni. Det kanske
            vore praktiskt att invänta den.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det fastslås i betänkandet att vi behöver egen kompetens inom
            strategiska materielområden. Det gäller områden som är specifikt
            svenska, kräver hög sekretess och områden som behövs för anpassningsdoktrinen.
            Man pekar bl.a. ut telekrigföring, undervattensteknik, signaturanpassning,
            JAS-system, befolkningsskydd, IT och NBC-skydd, för att ta några
            exempel.

            Jag vet inte om det räcker som förklaring till Lars
          </note>
          <note>
            Ångström. Jag kan dela uppfattningen att det i närtid måhända
            är en obalans i förhållandet mellan försvarsmaterielkostnader
            och personal- och utbildningskostnader. Men låt oss se det i ett
            långsiktigt perspektiv. Det tar tid att svänga om skutan. Som
            alla vet är många av dessa materielprojekt bundna i kontrakt som
            kan vara både kostnadskrävande och svåra att häva. Låt oss i den
            här frågan invänta ÖB:s materielplan.

            När det gäller Lars Ångströms fråga till mig beträffande miljösoldater
            och miljöbrigad vill jag bara hänvisa till att gällande lagstiftning
            är entydig. Den medger inte inskrivning och utbildning av värnpliktiga
            för dessa ändamål. Här är det bara att hänvisa till

          <note>
            Pliktutredningen, som måhända kan komma med förslag till ändringar.
            Med dagens lagstiftning är det inte möjligt.

            Fru talman! Centerpartiet vill medverka till att göra ett bra
            försvar bättre och avpassat för framtida hot och uppgifter. Det
            är grunden för vår försvarsöverenskommelse med regeringen och
            för vårt långsiktiga engagemang i försvarsfrågan. Försvars- och
            säkerhetspolitiken är fundamentet för den nationella suveräniteten.
            För mig och Centerpartiet är det otänkbart att reducera svensk
            försvarspolitik till ett politiskt spel.

            Erik Arthur Egervärn är klar över att det är Folkpartiets linje

          </note>
          <note>
            Det var faktiskt så att vi vid tiden för uppgörelsen hade mer
            omställningspengar, pengar som vi nu från
          </note>
          <note>
            Folkpartiet har flyttat. En del har vi flyttat över till vägpengar,
            något som vi anser vara regionalpolitiskt viktigt med tanke på
            hur vissa regioner kan drabbas av försvarsuppgörelsen.
          </note>
          <note>
            Förutom den miljard som är kvar finns det ytterligare pengar
            genom att vi också vill ha ett lägre värnpliktsintag. Det gör
            att våra pengar är mer än
          </note>
          <note>
            1 miljard. Och de skall användas till materielförsörjning. Då
            går vi inte in på några enskilda objekt, men det har ju nämnts
            Bamseprojektet m.m. som vi anser måste prioriteras om vi skall
            fortsätta med t.ex. JAS-

            Materielanskaffning och ett vassare militärt försvar är alltså

            värnpliktsutbildning, innebär.

            Fru talman! Jag vet inte om det var ett direkt svar på min fråga.
            Jag ville ha ett konkret besked om hur den här miljarden skall
            användas. Jag kan i och för sig förstå att det kan vara svårt
            för Runar Patriksson att exemplifiera och specificera. Vi väntar

          <note>
            Runar Patriksson har ju tidigare i ett inlägg sagt att Centerns
            och Socialdemokraternas uppgörelse inte har orkat ända fram. Då
            kan man fundera lite grann på vad det betyder. Om man säger att
            vi inte har orkat ända fram med besparingarna så tyder det väl
            närmast på att man skulle vilja göra ännu hårdare besparingar
            själv. Jag vet inte om det är avsikten i Runar Patrikssons formulering
            om att man inte har orkat ända fram.

            har hela tiden, även i förhandlingarna, hävdat att materielsidan
            måste stärkas. Ett vassare försvar innebär att miljarden används
            till materielanskaffning.

            Eftersom vi sitter kvar i beredningen och inte vill låsa positionerna
            i dag kan vi inte svara närmare än så. Men vi behöver mer pengar
            till försvarets omställning, och vi är kritiska till det sätt
            på vilket man löste problematiken omkring anslagsförordningen
            och teknikfaktorerna. Vi var på väg att få en bättre lösning.
            Det är materielsidan vi är inne på, och det kommer väl vad jag
            förstår att diskuteras längre fram i försvarsberedningen och utskottet.

            Runar Patrikssons formulering om att man vill nå ända fram, måste
            man väl ändå på något vis vara med? För Centern har det varit

            om målet. Det gäller bara att målet inte har nåtts i tillräckligt
            god tid eller nog hastigt, om jag tolkar Runar Patriksson rätt.

            Jag får inte riktigt Centerpartiets politik att gå ihop om man
            nu prioriterar materielinköp trots att vi enligt försvarsministern
            har ett av Europas mest moderna försvar. Om man prioriterar materielinköp
            innebär det att man måste skära ned mer på regementen. Att lägga
            ned regementen - onödigt många och onödigt snabbt - för att man
            hellre vill ha vapen får jag inte att gå ihop med att Centern
            är ute och talar för att hela landet skall leva. Man säger en
            sak, men politiken i praktiken leder till något helt annat. Jag

            Ångström. För det första delar jag uppfattningen att det kan finnas
            en obalans i närtid mellan materielkostnaden, materielandelen,
            i försvarsbudgeten och andelen som går till personal och utbildning.
            Men låt oss som sagt se det lite grann på sikt. Vi har fattat
            ett beslut 1995/96. Vi fattar ett nytt beslut nu 1999/2000. Det
            kommer ytterligare ett försvarsbeslut om några år. Låt oss se
            det i ett historiskt perspektiv så kanske den här eventuella obalansen
            kan komma att rättas till.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vi kan ju inte bortse från det faktum att vi har kontraktsbundna

            Det är, som jag sade, så att det finns ett antal strategiska
            materielområden där det i såväl Försvarsberedningen och regeringens
            proposition som betänkandet uttrycks att den här kompetensen måste
            finnas utifrån speciellt svenska förhållanden. Det gäller saker
            som krävs för anpassningsdoktrinen osv. Sedan finns det ett antal
            sådana här materielprojekt uppräknade. Slutligen: Låt oss nu invänta

            Jag förstod inte heller riktigt Centerpartiets resonemang när
            det gäller miljöbrigader. Visst är det så att lagstiftningen i
            dag hindrar upprättandet av insatsenheter för att hantera miljökatastrofer
            nationellt och internationellt. Men det kan ju inte vara ett argument
            för att behålla det som det är. I så fall är det väl, som Miljöpartiet
            har förespråkat, anledning att ändra lagstiftningen.

          <note>
            Jag har själv hört centerledaren Lennart Daléus tala i positiva
            ordalag omkring miljöbrigader. Det överensstämmer lite med den
            miljöprofil som Centern gärna vill ha. Men när det kommer till
            praktisk handling avslår man Miljöpartiets motion om att sätta
            upp en sådan här miljöbrigad och se till att ändra lagstiftningen
            så att det blir möjligt. Jag förstår inte riktigt hur retoriken
            utåt i samhället går ihop med den praktiska handlingen här i kammaren.

            Jag hänvisar, som jag sade tidigare, till Pliktutredningen. Om

            Fru talman! Dagens betänkande med anledning av regeringens proposition
            Förändrad omvärld - omdanat försvar lämnar mycket övrigt att önska.
            För att förstå den halvering av Försvarsmakten som blir resultatet
            av Socialdemokraternas och Centerns försvarsuppgörelse måste man
            titta tillbaka lite grann och se vad som har hänt sedan 1994.

            Jag kommer därför i mitt anförande att först ta upp handläggningen
            av försvarspolitiken och hur den påverkat Försvarsmaktens ekonomi.
            Därefter skall jag mycket kort kommentera försvarets förmåga samt
            totalförsvarsplikten.

          <note>
            När det gäller handläggningen av försvars- och säkerhetspolitiken
            kan jag konstatera att Socialdemokraterna och Centern har gått
            ifrån en ordning som gällt i Sverige under efterkrigstiden. Det
            har ju varit vanligt att de flesta partierna i Sveriges riksdag
            kommit överens om hur det skall gå till.

          <note>
            Inför varje försvarsbeslut t.o.m. 1992 års försvarsbeslut har
            först, antingen genom försvarsberedningar eller genom kommittéer,
            säkerhetspolitiken avdömts; detta innan anslagsramar och försvarets
            förmåga handlagts.
          </note>
          <note>
            Sedan 1994 har tågordningen varit en annan. Först har den ekonomiska
            ramen satts. Därefter har försvars- och säkerhetspolitiken mer
            eller mindre fått rätta sig därefter. Även om majoriteten i Försvarsberedningen
            inte varje dag medvetet sneglat på miljarderna kan man inte undgå
            att påverkas av de direktiv om ekonomin som regeringen tidigare
            har lagt. Så har det också varit inför det beslut som skall tas
            i dag. Att handlägga försvars- och säkerhetspolitik på detta sätt
            är, åtminstone enligt min mening, oacceptabelt.
          </note>
          <note>
            Så till ekonomin. 1996 års försvarsbeslut resulterade förutom
            i nedskuret anslag med 4 miljarder kronor per år också i en obalans
            mellan uppgift och ekonomi. Det ledde till minskad utbildning
            av verksamhet inom försvaret. Därefter fullföljde inte regeringen
            riksdagens beslut om kompensation till Försvarsmakten för ändringen
            av anslagsförordningen. Om det sedan gällde 2 eller 3 miljarder
            kronor per år kan vi lämna därhän men Försvarsmaktens planerade
            verksamhet och investeringar omkullkastades på mycket kort tid.

            I dag fullföljs raseringen av svenskt försvar genom en nedskärning
            med ytterligare 4 miljarder kronor per år. Sammantaget innebär
            de senaste årens nedskärningar och dagens beslut att försvarets
            förmåga att försvara hela Sverige måste, och kan, starkt ifrågasättas.

            Tidigare fanns det ett stort samförstånd om att flera brigader
            skulle kunna operera i vinterklimat. Nu är risken stor att inte
            ens en brigad blir fullt vinterutbildad. Som norrlänning som vet
            vilka förhållandena är blir jag ännu mer oroad över att utvecklingen

            Vi måste snabbt få ett beslut när det gäller uttagning av ungdomar
            genom pliktlagen. De senaste årens förändringar dels genom besparingar,
            dels på annat sätt har inneburit att stora förändringar i antalet
            värnpliktiga och kanske framför allt när det gäller de uppgifter
            som de är uttagna för inte har kunnat fullföljas. De som med kort
            varsel fått besked om att de inte kommer att inkallas har missat
            kanske både värnplikt och civil utbildning. Det är naturligtvis
            otillfredsställande. Därför måste vi se till att vi har en pliktlag
            som fungerar. Dessutom kommer kanske bara en tredjedel, eller
            drygt det, av dem som mönstrar att inkallas. Det är då också viktigt
            att få en rättvisa i det hela.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vi måste se till att också de värnpliktigas ekonomiska ersättning
            och meritvärdering ses över. I varje fall måste man kunna acceptera
            att man lever under en pliktlag. Orättvisan kan annars bli alltför

            Fru talman! Moderaterna har ju några extra miljarder - hur många
            är inte redigt klart - att spendera.

          <note>
            Då är frågan om det är som medierna beskriver - att, som Olle
            Lindström och andra moderater som åker runt och förklarar, i stort
            sett alla regementen kan räddas med just dessa miljarder. Eller
            är det så som

            Henrik Landerholm skriver i Svenska Dagbladet, nämligen att man
            måste använda de här medlen till att göra en snabbare omställning
            för att snabbare forma det nya försvaret? Skall man alltså hålla
            fast vid det gamla och rädda alla regementen med de extra miljarderna
            eller skall man använda pengarna offensivt för att gå mot det
            nya försvaret?

            Jag har med tillfredsställelse läst den moderata reservationen,
            som bl.a. Olle Lindström har skrivit under: "Mycket av det gamla
            måste successivt fasas ut - - -." Vidare står det: "I stället
            för en relativt stor men kvalitetsmässigt begränsad armé bör ett
            renodlat kvalitetskoncept väljas."

            Detta ligger helt i linje med det som regeringen föreslår. Min
            fråga till Olle Lindström är: Räddar era extra miljarder de regementen
            som du är ute och räddar eller säkerställer de en snabb omställning/omriktning
            av försvaret?

            Fru talman! Ja, Håkan Juholt, vi från moderata försvarskommittén
            åker runt i landet för att besöka så många platser som möjligt.
            Det är en fullständigt felaktig bild som Juholt talar om här.

            i Eksjö

            - talar vi om att inte ens med de moderata extra miljarderna
            kan alla förband eller grundorganisationen bibehållas.

            Självklart står vi bakom det som står i reservationen. Förändringen
            inom försvaret måste ske men inte på det sätt som Socialdemokraterna

            som man också i Olle Lindströms valkrets kommer att ha glädje
            av. Olle Lindström säger ju här i kammaren att även med moderat

            ned, till förmån för den omställning av försvaret som

            Socialdemokraterna och Centern genomför men som ni vill genomföra

            räddar regementena. Det tycker jag är ett klarläggande. Kanske
            har det inte varit fullkomligt tydliggjort tidigare men tydligen
            skall det bli på nämnda sätt.

            problematiken i mitt anförande.
          </note>
          <note>
            De kommande tio åren är det tänkt att vi skall satsa 7 miljarder
            per år på JAS-projektet. Det motsvarar ca 40 % av materielanskaffningen
            per år, och det motsvarar ca 20 % av de totala försvarsutgifterna
            per år i tio år framöver.
          </note>
          <note>
            När det första JAS-beslutet togs 1982 var det som ett led i att
            stärka invasionsförsvaret. När vi i dag fortsätter på den inslagna
            JAS-vägen är motiven inte längre i första hand försvarspolitiska
            utan snarare försvarsindustriella, för att inte säga kommersiella.

          <note>
            Förre försvarsministern, Tage G. Pettersson, tycker att vi bör
            sälja av 50 till 75 JAS-plan till Norge för att rädda hem några
            pengar. Nuvarande försvarsministern, Björn von Sydow, medger i
            en TT-intervju att egentligen behövs endast 60-80 flygplan för
            stridsbehov. Dessutom saknas i dag flygförare till de 200

            kostymen är för stor, och man skulle kunna spara minst 10 % på
            försvarsnotan eller ca 4 miljarder kronor per år om vi satsar
            på ett flygförsvar som motsvarar det angivna försvarsbehovet.
            Det är pengar som vi i stället kunde satsa på en kortare värnpliktsutbildning
            för pojkar och flickor eller föra över till den sociala infrastrukturen.

            JAS-projektet har varit i blåsväder tidigare men har fått leva
            vidare. I februari 1989 havererade det första planet vid den sjätte
            flygningen och kritiken blev stark. I augusti 1993 havererade
            JAS 39 vid en flyguppvisning i Stockholm trots att det vid det

            ett omoget flygplanssystem, att bränsle- och luftsystem fortfarande
            är en källa till bekymmer, att databussarna som enligt tillverkaren
            aldrig skulle orsaka problem ändå gör det. Reservdelsbristen är

            Det är ju inte min tolkning som är det viktiga. Det viktiga är
            hur landet Sydafrika tolkade det hela. Försvarsministern och presidenten
            tolkade alldeles uppenbart det Schyman sade i Sydafrika som att
            de inte borde köpa JAS-flygplan. Därmed uppmanade hon underförstått
            till att köpa flygplan från något annat land. Det sydafrikanska
            parlamentet hade ju redan beslutat om att anskaffa flygplan och

            1982, har ju visat sig vara en kombination av tillräckliga prestanda
            och ett mycket lågt pris. Framför allt är det på exportmarknaden
            av stort intresse att planet kan hanteras på ett ganska enkelt
            sätt också av värnpliktig personal på marken. Det är också ett
            plan som har låga drifts- och underhållskostnader, inte minst

            med dem som flygplanet konkurrerar med.

            När det gäller planets framtid är det lätt att hålla med om att

            det kommer att få brister i de olika roller som det har. Det är
            klart att det behöver utrustning. Varnar- och motmedelssystem
            är ett exempel, radarjaktrobot ett annat. Taurus, dvs. ett precisionsvapen

            planet. Men Henrik Landerholm räknade upp en massa brister som
            jag själv inte hade med i mitt inlägg: sådant som fattas, sådant
            som behövs och sådant som kostar ytterligare miljarder, som Carl
            Björeman tar upp här, för att vi skall få ett färdigt plan.

            Dessutom vet vi att det inte heller är Natokompatibelt, vilket
            naturligtvis försvårar exporten. Om vi skall vara riktigt konsekventa
            och bara satsa på JAS, skall vi väl gå med i Nato, men inte ens
            då är det säkert att vi får sälja planet, eftersom USA där kan
            lägga in veto mot det.

            Vi får också se hur läget är efter Kosovokriget, där vapenindustrin
            har fått göra massiva testningar, och vart utvecklingen av planen
            då kommer att gå. Vi kan vara väldigt glada över att JAS inte
            har kommit med i de sammanhangen, och jag tycker att det skall
            fortsätta att vara så.

            Men låt oss gärna exportera JAS som skolflygplan. Vi kan även

            Fru talman! Stig Sandström tog i sitt inledande anförande upp
            frågan vad svenska staten tjänar på att sälja JAS Gripen. Den
            kanske viktigaste vinsten är att vi kan dra ut på takten i våra
            egna leveranser och på det sättet minska den momentana ansträngningen
            på försvarsbudgeten. Det vore en välgärning.

            När det gäller interoperabiliteten lämnar planen i delserie 3
            inget övrigt att önska. Tvärtom marknadsförs planet nu inom ramen
            för samarbetet mellan
          </note>
          <note>
            Saab och BAe. Det senare företaget både ägs och drivs i ett Natoland.
            Jag bedömer att flygplanet har stora möjligheter på exportmarknaderna,
            eftersom kombinationen av pris och prestanda är mycket fördelaktig.
            Många, framför allt mindre, länder har inte råd att satsa på flygplan
            av den storlek, dignitet och kostnad som bl.a. prövas just nu
            i Kosovo.

            Jag har dessutom i senaste numret av Ny Teknik sett att man redan

            plan, som Saab i Linköping har jobbat länge med. Också detta är

            Fru talman! De flesta bedömare anser att ett invasionshot mot
            Sverige för närvarande inte är överhängande. Regeringen anser
            inte heller att ett invasionshot skulle kunna utvecklas under
            de närmaste tio åren, förutsatt att vi har kvar en grundläggande
            försvarsförmåga, som vi alldeles nyss hörde försvarsministern
            säga. Men någon förklaring av vad en grundläggande försvarsförmåga
            är har jag varken hört eller sett. Här kommer väl ett av problemen
            i den här debatten, nämligen att det saknas en grundläggande analys
            av hoten och möjligheterna och behoven av att möta dem, så att
            angripare verkligen blir bemötta och avväpnade. Den hotbild som
            har tagits fram beskriver, som jag ser det, inte Sverige som en
            del i ett större internationellt sammanhang.

            Fru talman! Det skulle vara intresssant att få veta vad som egentligen
            menas med en grundläggande försvarsförmåga. Var ligger gränsen
            för den uppåt och nedåt? Kan möjligen socialdemokraterna ge ett
            svar på den frågan? Som lekman men ändå ansvarig politiker anser
            jag att det fordras en mycket god analys av situation, hotbild
            och Sveriges möjligheter att försvara sig om det skulle behövas,
            dvs. om det som många anser obefintliga hotet blir ett befintligt
            hot.

            I kristdemokraternas motion med anledning av regeringens proposition
            1998/99:74 Förändrad omvärld - omdanat försvar framhåller vi bl.a.:
            "I sin bedömning av det säkerhetspolitiska läget tar regeringen
            dock inte tillräcklig hänsyn till den spända situation som uppkommit
            i och med krigen på Balkan under 90-talet, Irak-krisen eller situationen
            i Turkiet.

            Det spända läget mellan olika länder i forna Sovjetunionen och

            Makt- och styrkeambitioner kan ta sig andra uttryck och ge andra
            hotbilder än de traditionella. För att ge landet ett fullgott
            försvarspolitiskt skydd måste därför de traditionella säkerhets-
            och försvarspolitiska ställningstagandena även inkludera annorlunda,
            oväntade och komplexa hot. Det kan exempelvis vara miljöförstörelse
            av dumpat kärnavfall, läckande atomdrivna u-båtar och kärnkraftverk,
            kärnvapen och missiler i orätta händer, terrorverksamhet, sabotage
            etc. Sveriges allt större militära internationella engagemang
            kan också komma att innebära konfrontationer med andra länder
            och grupper. För ett gott försvarspolitiskt skydd måste även dessa
            faktorer medräknas i hotbilden."

            sammanhängande planeringsförutsättningar och att det görs före

            Regeringen drar dock inte andra konsekvenser av detta konstaterande

            anser att en förutsättning för en planering av totalförsvaret,
            inklusive civilförsvaret, är att en sådan utredning, som bör vara
            parlamentarisk och ha klart angivna mål och tidsramar, skyndsamt
            igångsätts.

          <note>
            Sarajevo. Där levde människor belägrade, omringade och beskjutna
            under flera år. Det som bl.a. räddade dem var att det civila samhället
            organiserade sig, enligt min tolkning, med målsättningen Sarajevos
            överlevnad. När situationen var som svårast och det offentliga
            systemet mer eller mindre rasade ihop, växte det snabbt upp ett
            frivilligt nätverk eller system som tog tag i olika verksamhetsområden.
            Det gällde barnomsorg, äldrevård, sjukvård, social omvårdnad,
            kulturliv m.m. Många frivilliga anmälde sig.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vad jag menar med detta är att det civila samhället i sig har
            en inneboende dynamik som måste kunna tas till vara då alla telekommunikationer
            har upphört, det elektriska systemet slagits sönder, vatten och
            avlopp slutat att fungera, värmeledningarna slagits ut osv.
          </note>
          <note>
            Fru talman! Hotbilden för det civila samhället är ganska dyster.
            Men det är svårt att avgöra varifrån hoten kan komma och vilka
            konsekvenserna kan bli om de verkställs.
          </note>
          <note>
            Infrastrukturen med elförsörjning, telekommunikationer och informationsteknik
            är sårbara och utsatta områden. Eftersom hoten är oförutsägbara
            kommer också civilbefolkningen att vara mycket utsatt och sårbar.
            Det civila försvaret måste ha en nyckelroll i det framtida försvaret.
          </note>
          <note>
            Fru talman! Regeringen har mycket knapphändigt belyst specificering
            av och förslag om hur infrastrukturen kan skyddas. Visserligen
            talas det om att säkerheten måste utvecklas och systemen ses över,
            men några direkta förslag om hur detta skall ske finns inte. Det
            talas om att enskilda enheter och verksamheter själva måste ordna
            sitt försvar, samtidigt som regeringen helt konkret pekar på behovet
            av exempelvis reservaggregat för elförsörjningen. Men även dessa
            aggregat föreslås att olika verksamheter själva skall anskaffa,
            eventuellt i samarbete med kommunerna.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vi kristdemokrater anser att skyddet för telekommunikationerna
            snarast måste bli i sådant skick att de kan fungera vid ett väpnat
            angrepp. Den av regeringen planerade inriktningen på åtgärder
            för att garantera säkerheten i telenäten måste således snarast
            påbörjas.
          </note>
          <note>
            Fru talman! Vi anser inte att den bristande tillgången på personella
            bevakningsresurser, som regeringen anger, skall vara ett skäl
            för att inte skydda viktiga anläggningar inom elförsörjningen.
            En sådan brist måste också med det snaraste kunna avhjälpas.
          </note>
          <note>
            Bevakningen av den sårbara elförsörjningen måste intensifieras,
            så att den skyddas från såväl angrepp från nära håll som från
            precisionsbekämpning med luftburna vapen med lång räckvidd.
          </note>
          <note>
            Fru talman! Sammanfattningsvis så här långt kräver kristdemokraterna
            en grundläggande analys av de nya hotens konsekvenser för civilbefolkningen,
            dvs.
          </note>
          <note>
            hur civilbefolkningen kan skyddas och användas för att samhället
            skall fungera i krissituationer. I detta sammanhang bör också
            försörjningsberedskapen och behoven av skyddsrum utredas. Den
            offentliga sektorns plats måste belysas i detta arbete, dvs. sjukvård,
            barnomsorg och äldreomsorg. Polis- och brandväsende ingår också
            i den bilden liksom integrering av räddningstjänsten i civilförsvaret.
            De frivilliga organisationernas plats i detta arbete måste vara
            en viktig utgångspunkt.
          </note>
          <note>
            Fru talman! Kristdemokraterna anser dessutom att den nya hotbilden
            för det civila samhället och en förändrad organisation kräver
            en samlad översyn av ledningssystemet. Det vidgade säkerhetsbegreppet
            och avsikten att använda totalförsvarsresurser inom ett brett
            spektrum av extraordinära händelser gör att det civila och det
            militära ledningssystemet måste ses i ett sammanhang. Utgångspunkten
            skall vara att totalförsvarskonceptet skall utvecklas genom en
            så långt möjligt samordnad civil och militär ledning i hela skalan
            från fred till krig. Hänsyn bör tas till vardagsförhållandena,
            förmågan till anpassning och kravet på snabbhet i beslutsfattandet.
            Dessutom bör risken för informationskrigföring beaktas. Länsstyrelsernas
            kompetens i totalförsvarsfrågor måste säkerställas, liksom god
            förankring hos de frivilliga försvarsorganisationerna.
          </note>
          <note>
            Den översyn med parlamentarisk insyn som aviseras när det gäller
            ledningssystemet bör genomföras snabbt, så att beslut kan fattas
            samordnat och i takt med den övriga omstruktureringen av grund-
            och krigsorganisationen. Några större förändringar när det gäller
            ledningsfrågan bör därför inte genomföras i närtid.

            Vill man vara förstående och vänlig, vilket i de flesta fall
            är en god egenskap, kan man förklara regeringens förslag med att
            regeringen inte insåg vilka allvarliga följder förslaget skulle
            få. Är man mer realistisk, vilket även det är en egenskap att
            föredra, inser man att den framlagda ramen för Försvarsmakten
            inte har med kloka bedömningar och sund försvarspolitik att göra,

            ÖB har som första punkt i sin hemställan föreslagit att en omprövning
            görs av den gällande säkerhetspolitiska bedömningen och den därmed
            sammanhängande planeringsförutsättningen. ÖB, liksom de flesta

            bedömning som regeringen presenterat inte stämmer med nuvarande
            faktiska situation. Säger regeringen nej till en omprövning eller
            bortser från konsekvenserna av en annan bedömning, innebär det

            Fru talman! En av de viktigaste utgångspunkterna för att över
            huvud taget genomföra en bantning och omstrukturering av försvaret
            är möjligheterna till anpassning och tillväxt, om hotet ökar eller
            riskerna förändras.
          </note>
          <note>
            Regeringen skriver själv i propositionen att förändringar av
            hot och risker bedöms kunna ske snabbare nu än under det kalla
            kriget. Enligt vår bedömning kommer försvaret inte att ha kompetens
            och styrka att möta dessa hot och risker, om nu föreslagen ram
            blir verklighet.

            Om vi under en tidshorisont på 10-15 år är säkra på en stabil
            och positiv utveckling i vår omvärld, kan man till nöds acceptera
            neddragningarna. Men vem är här beredd att garantera en sådan
            utveckling?

            Återkommande har vi moderater kritiserat de bristfälliga förberedelser
            som gjorts för att ge anpassningsteorin ett reellt innehåll. Man
            kan på goda grunder misstänka att denna filosofi endast är en
            ursäkt för att kunna genomföra stora nedskärningar.

          <note>
            Varken myndigheterna eller regeringen har givit anpassningsfilosofin
            ett så konkret innehåll att planeringen utgjort en trovärdig grund
            för tillväxt respektive ändrad inriktning.

            Enligt vår mening skall varje försvarsorganisation innehålla
            komponenter som gör att försvaret snabbt och effektivt kan anpassas
            till förändrade förutsättningar i omvärlden.

            Fru talman! Möjligheterna till anpassning blir mycket begränsade
            om detta förslag blir verklighet.
          </note>
          <note>
            I propositionen beskrivs de svårigheter som finns inför beslut
            om successiva anpassningsåtgärder. Det krävs en stor mängd underrättelseinformation
            för att upptäcka svaga signaler. Förändringar i små steg är svåra
            att tolka innan det blir alltför sent. Det finns betydande svårigheter
            att förutspå händelseutvecklingar som avviker ifrån senare års
            mönster.
          </note>
          <note>
            Precis som regeringen själv säger i propositionen är det ofrånkomligt
            att beslut om anpassningsåtgärder kommer att fattas under betydande
            osäkerhet. Om anpassningsåtgärder skall hinna vidtas måste beslut
            och andra ställningstaganden grundas på då befintligt underlag,
            vilket i efterhand kan komma att ifrågasättas.
          </note>
          <note>
            I beslutskedjan måste också finnas beslut och åtgärder för tillförsel
            av resurser, materielanskaffning, utbildning, övning och insats.
            Enligt vår bedömning är denna kedja alltför bräcklig och kommer,
            om den någonsin fungerar, alltid att medföra att vi är för sent
            ute.
          </note>
          <note>
            Tänk tanken, fru talman, den otäcka tanken, att det förhåller
            sig så att vi redan för tio år sedan skulle ha nedrustat och att
            det faktiskt är nu vi skall ha påbörjat eller t.o.m. genomfört
            anpassningen!

            Fru talman! Det är ju lämpligt att Björn Leivik lyfter upp just
            detta ämne i dag när det PM som handlar om fortsatt uppdrag för
            Försvarsberedningen ligger i våra postfack inför utskottets sammanträde

            den säkerhetspolitiska utvecklingen i omvärlden och inför regeringens
            förslag till riksdagen i viktiga långsiktiga försvars- och säkerhetspolitiska
            frågor redovisa sin syn på dessa.

            Fru talman! Juholt har säker läst denna också, nämligen Förändrad
            omvärld - omdanat försvar, rapport från Försvarsberedningen inför
            1999 års kontrollstation. Där är man mycket tydlig när det gäller
            anpassningen. Man skriver: Tanken bakom anpassningsfilosofin för
            försvaret är att tidiga signaler rörande förändringar i vår säkerhetspolitiska
            situation skall kunna upptäckas i så god tid att vi står väl rustade
            när förändringarna har inträffat. Det torde inte vara lätt att
            få denna filosofi att fungera i det praktiska arbetet. Det finns
            internationellt många exempel på att förvarningssignalerna inte
            har uppfattats eller att man inte har tagit hänsyn till dem.

            Fru talman! I betänkandet på s. 32 och 33 skissas den här modellen
            väldigt detaljerat. Bl.a. står det att anpassningsförmågan skall
            förbättras genom utvecklad underrättelsetjänst och utvecklat kunnande
            om olika typer av hot och hur de skall mötas. Man skall utarbeta
            femåriga planer för anpassningsåtgärder, vidta åtgärder för att
            reducera bindningar i materiel och personal, främja materielförsörjningen
            internationellt osv. Hela den här modellen beskrivs, men poängen
            i modellen är att det konkreta arbetet sedan skall utföras i Försvarsberedningen.

            Där står det uttryckligen att allt detta skall omsättas i arbete
            i Försvarsberedningen, och där vill inte Moderaterna vara med.
            De säger att det är viktigt att det görs, men det är viktigt att
            någon annan gör det. Jag tycker att det är en konstig hållning.

            Fru talman! Regeringens hantering av försvaret hotar nu stora
            delar av en hel näringsgren. De kraftiga neddragningar i försvarsekonomin
            som drivits igenom av Socialdemokraterna och Centern kopplat med
            regeringen oförmåga att ge besked om viktiga materielprojekt riskerar
            en stor del av den svenska försvarsindustrin. Därmed hotas också
            en av hörnpelarna för vår säkerhetspolitik. Stora och viktiga
            kompetensområden riskeras, samarbete med den utländska försvarsindustrin
            försvåras och tusentals arbetstillfällen är i fara. Det är regeringen
            och Centerpartiet som är ansvariga för den oro och den osäkerhet
            som nu finns vid några av Sveriges högteknologiska centrum.

          <note>
            Den svenska försvarsindustrin har en mycket hög och bred teknisk
            kompetens. Inom en rad teknikområden är den svenska försvarsindustrin
            i världsklass.

            Detta har skapat spin-off-effekter och gett goda förutsättningar
            också för annan industri. Mobiltelefonin är kanske det främsta
            exemplet på hur teknik från försvarsindustrin i dag genererar
            verksamheter med mångmiljardomsättningar. Det är också en verksamhet

            Europa. Jag vill att den svenska försvarsindustrin skall kunna
            ta aktiv del av och bli en intressant partner i ett sådant samarbete.
            Om det skall bli möjligt fordras det svenska utvecklingsprojekt,
            materielbeställningar, goda möjligheter till export och, inte
            minst viktigt, politiskt stöd för detta.

            För att behålla en fortsatt stark svensk försvarsindustri måste
            samverkan med den europeiska försvarsindustrin prioriteras. När
            regeringen nu skjuter på och ifrågasätter beslut om viktiga utvecklingsprojekt
            förhindras detta samarbete.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det krävs ett antal förutsättningar för ett framgångsrikt samarbete.
            Den svenska industrin måste tillföra samarbetet viktig kompetens.
            För det fordras fortsatta utvecklingssatsningar samt att kompetensområden
            inte avvecklas. Vidare behövs likartade exportregler. Det krävs
            också långsiktiga åtagande av beställningar och utvecklingsprojekt.
            Allt detta riskerar nu att raseras av regeringens hantering av
            försvarsekonomin. Det vore förödande att, när vi nu ser möjligheterna
            till ett utvidgat samarbete med den europeiska industrin ta form,
            ta bort möjligheterna för den svenska industrin att delta.
          </note>
          <note>
            Exporten kommer att vara viktig för möjligheterna att upprätthålla
            kompetensen inom försvarsindustrins olika delar. Det kräver samsyn
            mellan länderna vad gäller tillåtna exportområden. Ett svenskt
            deltagande i samarbetsprojekt kommer inte att vara intressant
            om det innebär att viktiga exportmarknader inte blir tillgängliga.
          </note>
          <note>
            Om försvarsindustrin inte får besked och beställningar kan stora

            Kosovokriget visar att kompetensen och kunnandet inom området
            styrda vapen blir alltmer strategiskt viktig och att kompetensområdet

            Fru talman! Det allra sämsta sättet att använda försvarsanslag
            och materielanskaffningspengar vore att nu avveckla Bamsesystemet.
            Det är ett system som vi nu har plöjt ned 2 miljarder kronor i.
            Det är ett system som vi har investerat betydande kompetens och
            kunnande i, som har stor exportpotential och stor möjlighet att
            dra in pengar till svensk industri och ge svenska jobb. Att i
            dag avveckla Bamsesystemet skulle innebära att de 2 miljarderna
            vore förlorade.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det skulle innebära att försvarsförmågan som ligger i det systemet
            skulle behöva ersättas med ett annat system utifrån, sannolikt
            dyrare. Jag har inte hört någon bedömare säga att vi inte behöver
            den typen av luftvärn.

            Därmed blir den politik som Håkan Juholt och socialdemokratin
            driver på detta område både dyr och skadlig för försvaret. Det
            kostar mycket pengar att kasta vapensystem och försvarsindustrisystem
            i sjön.
          </note>
          <note>
            Därför behövs långsiktighet, så att vi kan utlova att de materielprojekt
            som vi är överens om att försvaret behöver för sin förmåga kan
            rulla vidare. Därför behöver vi ett system där regeringen inte
            i ett nafs drar in ett antal miljarder från framför allt materielanskaffning
            via en ändrad anslagsförordning. Det leder till bortkastade pengar

            Jag vill påminna Ola Karlsson om att en sådan utredning faktiskt
            jobbar just nu. Direktiven till Försvarsberedningen lyder: "Försvarsberedningen

            Man drar i ett nafs in 6-7 miljarder, vilket ger mycket stora
            effekter för försvarsindustrin och förmågan att utveckla de system
            vi är överens om kommer att behövas i det svenska försvaret. Den
            politiken är dyrbar. Den politiken är skadlig. Den politiken riskerar
            många av de jobb som finns runtom i landet.

            Vi borde slå vakt om alla de jobb som finns i försvarsindustrin
            och de möjligheter till export av mycket bra system som kommer
            att behövas i det svenska försvaret.

            Fru talman! I dagens debatt har det varit tydligt hur viktigt
            det är för vårt land att kunna bidra med väpnade styrkor i det
            internationella samfundets tjänst. Samtliga partier har i debatten
            i dag uttalat sitt stöd för deltagande i fredsfrämjande internationella
            uppdrag.
          </note>

            Vår utlandsstyrka arbetar konkret med uppgiften att sätta kraft
            bakom alla de ord vi hört i debatten i dag och upprätthåller ordning
            och skyddar människor i konfliktdrabbade områden. Tyvärr är det
            ett farligt och riskfyllt uppdrag för dem som arbetar i utlandsstyrkan.
            Insatserna görs just i områden och situationer med krig, kaos
            och förstörelse.

            Fru talman! Det är sorgligt att behöva konstatera att vårt omhändertagande
            av och ansvarstagande för dem som råkat illa ut i sina riskfyllda
            uppdrag har varit mycket bristfälligt. Våra sociala skyddsnät
            är tyvärr inte anpassade för tillfälliga tjänstgöringar, vilket
            har drabbat dem som har skadats vid utlandsuppdragen mycket hårt
            och tydligt.

            I vårt land förutsätter vi ofta försäkringar och trygghet när
            olyckan är framme. Att det inte alltid är så och vilka följderna
            kan bli framgick tydligt i ett brev som jag fick i vintras från
            en mamma till en ung man som skadats allvarligt vid tjänstgöringen
            i utlandsstyrkan. Han hade mist båda sina ben vid en minexplosion
            vid tjänstgöring i Bosnien. Mamman skriver att ännu tre år efter
            en så svår skada är framtiden osäker.

            Hon har fört en ständig kamp för att få hjälp, rehabilitering
            och säkrad försörjning för sin son. Hon har skrivit flera hundra
            brev till departement, myndigheter och politiker. Hon har blivit
            bollad än till den ena, än till den andra myndigheten, och har
            sett sig tvungen att anlita advokater och jurister för att få
            hjälp.

            Enskilda tjänstemän har naturligtvis försökt att göra vad de
            kan, men när det varken har funnits pengar, privata försäkringar
            eller statliga försäkringar som gällt har det inte gått att göra
            något.

            Vad som krävs - ett krav som denna proposition faktisk är ett
            svar på - är ett försäkringsskydd för dem som tjänstgör i utlandsstyrkan.
            Ett sådant försäkringsskydd anser vi moderater självklart måste
            vara generöst utformat och motsvara den uppskattning och tacksamhet
            som vi vill visa mot de unga människor som frivilligt åtar sig
            dessa uppdrag. Det får helt enkelt inte finnas den minsta tvekan
            om att staten är beredd att ta ett mycket långtgående ansvar när
            det gäller att ta hand om och sörja för dem som ställt upp för
            landet i fredsbevarande insatser i konflikt- och krigsdrabbade
            områden.

            De som tjänstgör är kontraktsanställda, ofta under sex månader.
            De flesta är unga och värvas i anslutning till värnplikten. De
            har inte hunnit skaffa sig civil utbildning, arbete eller yrkeskarriär.
            Vad värre är - de har inte hunnit skaffa sig de ordentliga inkomster
            som krävs för att t.ex. vår arbetsskadeförsäkring, sjukpenning
            och pension skall komma i funktion. De svenska arbetsskadeförsäkrings-
            och rehabiliteringsreglerna är dåligt anpassade till tillfälliga
            anställningar och förutsätter stabil inkomst och arbete. Detta
            sätts i blixtbelysning när det gäller de skadade i utlandsstyrkan.
          </note>
          <note>
            Tyvärr har den som tjänstgör i utlandsstyrkan inte heller möjlighet
            att skaffa egen försäkring, eftersom det tyvärr är så att försäkringar
            inte gäller i krigssituationer. Tjänstgöringen innebär en risk
            att skadas.
          </note>
          <note>
            Den risken uppskattas att vara tre gånger så stor som i andra
            farliga yrken.

            Regeringen lägger fram förslag i sin proposition som är steg
            på vägen för att förbättra skyddet. Förslagen innebär tyvärr att
            man hamnar på någonting som kan beskrivas som en miniminivå. Det
            är oroande att det inte står någonting om hur Försvarsmakten,
            som ges uppgiften att rehabilitera, skall få ersättning.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vi moderater anser att förslaget måste kännetecknas av generositet
            och innebära ett fullgott försäkringsskydd. Vi har lagt fram förslag
            om att arbetsskadeförsäkringen skall ge en summa motsvarande den
            ersättning man faktiskt har under tjänstgöringen, även om man
            inte får något nytt arbete när man kommer hem. Det är det som
            är problemet. De har inte arbete när de kommer tillbaka.

          <note>
            Vi har således på detta sätt fått ett basskydd och en grund,
            men vi anser att staten måste stå för ett bra försäkringsskydd
            som också ersätter den som drabbats av att det inte går att skaffa
            egna tilläggsförsäkringar.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vi har föreslagit att försäkringsskyddet skall ge en ersättning
            som åtminstone uppgår till nivån för den riskgaranti som föreslås
            av utredningen som föregått propositionen. Förslaget innebar en
            rejäl engångssumma, kompletterat med en periodisk summa som uppgår
            till 6 000 kr i månaden, vid total invaliditet.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det förslaget skulle innebära att en person som har förlorat
            båda benen, vilket räknas som 50-
          </note>
          <note>
            procentig invaliditet, skulle få 3 000 kr i månaden för hjälpmedel
            och en engångssumma på 350 000 kr, som åtminstone räcker till
            en handikappanpassad bil.
          </note>
          <note>
            Denna riskgaranti, som vi tycker skall utformas på ett generöst
            sätt och inte på det mera försiktiga och snåla sätt som regeringen
            aviserar att den kan komma att föreslå, skall utgå utan villkor
            i förhållande till medicinsk invaliditet. Den skall inte vara
            villkorad på så många sätt som den vanliga arbetsskadeförsäkringen
            är.
          </note>
          <note>
            De som har skadats måste också få rehabilitering så länge som
            det behövs, enligt det förslag som vi moderater har lagt fram.
            Det är tyvärr svårt att få rehabilitering när man är s.k. medicinskt
            färdigbehandlad, och det är osäkert om man får det. Det är en
            besvärlig gränsdragning mellan kommun och landsting. Försvarsmakten,
            eller den som har ansvaret för rehabiliteringen, måste naturligtvis
            få ersättning för det. Reglerna får inte vara otydliga och krångliga,
            så att det tar flera år att reda ut om man har rätt till rehabilitering.
          </note>
          <note>
            Regeringen föreslår också att lagen om anställningsskydd inte
            skall gälla vid tjänstgöring i utlandsstyrkan. Det är lite skillnad
            jämfört med vad som gäller för andra som sänds utomlands. Detta
            är ett extra skäl till att vi skall ha ett stärkt skadeskydd,
            eftersom rehabiliteringsansvaret är knutet till anställning och
            arbetsgivare. Detta är också ett skäl att överväga om ansvaret
            för rehabilitering kanske skall organiseras på annat sätt och
            läggas på någon annan än Försvarsmakten, som ju har väldigt mycket
            att genomföra de närmaste åren, är hårt belastad av stora neddragningar
            och skall avskeda 10 000 människor.
          </note>
          <note>
            Kanske borde man fundera på om ansvaret borde läggas på annat
            håll.
          </note>
          <note>
            Med anledning av det som har framgått av utredningen bakom denna
            proposition har vi också föreslagit att skadeskyddet för de vanliga
            värnpliktiga som tjänstgör här i Sverige under värnpliktsutbildningen
            borde ses över.

            Sverige har, fru talman, kunnat bidra i många missioner som hjälpt
            till med försvar av frihet, mänskliga rättigheter och fred. Det
            är en stor uppgift för de unga män och kvinnor som tjänstgör i
            Sveriges utlandsstyrka. Om vi vill bidra med säkerhetsfrämjande
            styrkor måste vi också, fru talman, vara beredda att ta ansvar
            för ett försäkringsskydd som är så tydligt utformat att den enskilde
            enkelt kan ta ställning till risker och förmåner. De som åtar
            sig att tjänstgöra i utlandsstyrkan måste kunna vara säkra på
            att de har ett fullgott försäkringsskydd som gäller.

            Fru talman! Ärade ledamöter och åhörare! Under denna dag har
            vi brutit åsikter mot varandra när det gäller säkerhets- och försvarspolitiken,
            men vi har varit överens i någon mening. Det gäller åsikten att
            vi bör satsa på fredsbefrämjande och fredsbevarande missioner.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vi har en lång tradition på detta område här i Sverige. Sveriges
            rykte, i egenskap av neutral och alliansfri stat, kan betyda mycket
            för fredsarbetet ute i världen.
          </note>
          <note>
            Den nyinriktning av försvarspolitiken som vi skall besluta om
            innebär på sikt också ett utökat engagemang inom detta område,
            med alltfler i utlandsstyrkan i framtiden. Därför är det så oerhört
            viktigt att skyddet för de unga män och kvinnor som på FN:s eller
            OSSE:s uppdrag genomför detta ansvarsfulla och viktiga arbete
            är det absolut bästa skydd man kan få.
          </note>
          <note>
            Att förebygga skador är absolut det viktigaste av allt. God utbildning
            och noggrant förarbete är därför a och o, och likaså att de lagar
            om arbetsmiljö och arbetarskydd som kan tillämpas ute i en internationell
            mission också efterlevs.
          </note>
          <note>
            Risken att skadas och invalidiseras i samband med tjänst i utlandsstyrkan
            är trots detta större än i många andra riskfyllda arbeten. När
            de dessutom går ut i en frivillig mission för fredens skull och
            för allas vår strävan efter en bättre situation i omvärlden är
            ansvaret för oss naturligtvis än tyngre. Därför är regeringens
            initiativ på området både nödvändigt och mycket efterlängtat.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vänsterpartiet har dock motionerat om förändringar och förbättringar
            av detta regeringens förslag.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vi ansåg t.ex. att livränteunderlaget skulle vara sju basbelopp
            i stället för, som föreslagits, fem. Att man har valt just fem
            basbelopp kan bero på att lönen för några år sedan motsvarade
            just fem basbelopp, men man hade en massa tillägg som inte var
            beskattade och därmed inte heller pensionsgrundande. Nu har man
            ändrat systemet, och lönen motsvarar nu sju basbelopp; man har
            tagit bort alla dessa tillägg.
          </note>
          <note>
            Åsikten om att det skulle vara sju basbelopp delades av de flesta
            av oss. Utskottets förslag sammanfaller därför med Vänsterpartiets
            i denna del, vilket vi är väldigt glada över.
          </note>
          <note>
            Försvarsmaktens rehabiliteringsansvar skall enligt regeringens
            förslag omfatta tre år med möjlighet till en förlängning på två
            år. Även om det gavs en liten möjlighet att utöka det här ansvaret
            ansåg vi inte att det var tillräckligt. Det är inte orimligt att
            tänka sig att den skadade har behov av en mycket längre rehabiliteringstid,
            även om det kan räcka med den här tiden för de flesta, men att
            Försvarsmakten anser att det räcker med tre plus två år, dvs.
            fem år, som är inskrivet. Det skulle då kunna uppkomma en konflikt
            mellan den som skulle behöva den här rehabiliteringen och Försvarsmakten.
            Och vi vet hur det brukar bli i sådana här sammanhang. Det är
            den enskilde som kommer i kläm. De i utlandsstyrkan riskerar också
            att få psykiska bekymmer senare, och psykiska skador som beror
            på upplevelser som de har haft i sin mission kan komma ganska
            långt efter det att de har kommit hem, och de kan också bli akuta.
            Därför ansåg vi att det, när det gäller Försvarsmaktens rehabiliteringsansvar,
            borde vara en individuell prövning och att man därför inte borde
            ha så snäva och klara gränser. En individuell prövning skulle
            också vara tryggare för den enskilde, om behovet uppkommer.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det här kravet fick inte gillande i utskottet. Därför har vi
            en reservation när det gäller den frågan som jag härmed yrkar
            bifall till.
          </note>
          <note>
            Fru talman! Vänsterpartiet hade också i sin motion om utlandsstyrkan
            en mängd olika förslag för att förbättra de anhörigas möjligheter.
            Det gäller i första hand ersättningen för de anhöriga. Det är
            oerhört viktigt att de närmaste har möjlighet att vara den skadade
            till hjälp både i det akuta skedet och under kanske en lång och
            svår rehabiliteringstid. Närheten av en eller flera anhöriga kan
            vara den faktor som ger den skadade livsmod och styrka att kämpa
            vidare, att jobba på. Men det här har också en stor betydelse
            när det gäller att förebygga framtida psykiska komplikationer.
            Därför ansåg vi att regeringen var för njugg i fråga om ersättningsnivåerna
            och retroaktiviteten när det gällde stödet till de anhöriga. Vi
            ville också trycka mycket hårdare än regeringen på Försvarsmaktens
            ansvar för rehabiliteringsinsatserna.
          </note>
          <note>
            Dessa åsikter fick vi inte stöd för i utskottet. Vi kan i viss
            mån hålla med om att det är viktigt att dessa nya regler kan tillämpas
            så snabbt som möjligt. Vi hade ganska omfattande förslag, och
            vi tycker fortfarande att de var riktiga, men dessa ändringar
            skulle kunna försena arbetet. Därför har vi valt att avge ett
            yttrande i det här avseendet. Men eftersom det skall bli en uppföljning
            av ärendet och av lagen ges det en möjlighet att senare komma
            med förslag om förbättringar om det visar sig vara nödvändigt.
            Därför kommer vi nogsamt att följa detta ärende i framtiden.

            Fru talman! Jag är stolt över att det i vårt land
          </note>
          <note>
            Sverige finns män och kvinnor som ställer upp. Det är män och
            kvinnor som lämnar den trygga vardagsmiljön här hemma, som lämnar
            vänner och familj för ställa upp på de fredsbevarande operationer
            som vi i den här kammaren har gett klartecken för svenskt deltagande
            i.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det är en förmån för ett land att ha sådana medborgare. Dessa
            män och kvinnor är alltså villiga att utsätta sig för risker och
            faror som vi normalt inte möter i vårt land. Jag är glad att det
            finns så många som vill ställa upp i utlandsstyrkan. Om jag själv
            fick bestämma skulle vi ge alla dem som deltar i utlandstjänstgöring
            en medalj, för det är de väl värda.
          </note>
          <note>
            Tyvärr är det här uppdraget förenat med vissa faror och riskmoment,
            en del farligare än andra. Det har ju hänt genom årens lopp att
            vissa svenska medborgare har blivit skadade i en fredsbevarande
            operation.
          </note>
          <note>
            Trots att vi från statsapparatens sida försöker att minimera
            riskerna och öka säkerheten för enskilda soldater eller civilpersonal
            som är anställda på uppdrag så händer detta ibland. Utan att vara
            en domedagsprofet kan jag inte utesluta att det även i framtiden
            kommer att inträffa skador som drabbar enskilda.
          </note>
          <note>
            Fru talman! Vi har i den här kammaren ett gemensamt ansvar som
            uppdragsgivare för dessa män och kvinnor. De har gjort en förtjänstfull
            insats och skall få ett erkännande för det. Jag tror att det finns
            en ganska bred enighet om detta, både här i kammaren och ute hos
            svenska folket i allmänhet.
          </note>
          <note>
            Tyvärr har det under behandlingen av det här betänkandet visat
            sig att vi har varit väldigt dåliga på att ta hand om de människor
            som har skadats under fredsbevarande operationer som vi har deltagit
            i. Det har inte funnits någon myndighet som har haft huvudansvaret
            för de här människorna. Det har inneburit att människor har hamnat
            mellan stolarna i olika försäkringssystem. Man har inte vetat
            vart man skall vända sig för att få hjälp.
          </note>
          <note>
            Många av dem som tjänstgör i utlandsstyrkan har, precis som vi
            har hört tidigare i debatten, inte haft någon fast anställning
            tidigare. Det är unga män och kvinnor som kanske kommer direkt
            från en värnpliktstjänstgöring eller något annat, och därför faller
            de inte under den allmänna arbetsskadeförsäkringen och det ansvar
            som finns hos arbetsgivarna där.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det är därför positivt att regeringen nu har föreslagit att Försvarsmakten
            skall vara den myndighet som har ett rehabiliteringsansvar. Regeringen
            har föreslagit att det här skall gälla i tre plus två år.
          </note>
          <note>
            Men vi kristdemokrater tycker inte att det här räcker. Vi måste
            se varje människa och den situation man har hamnat i som unik.
            Försvarsmaktens ansvar bör inte begränsas. Försvarsmakten bör
            ha ett livslångt ansvar för de här människorna.
          </note>
          <note>
            Även om behandlingen och rehabiliteringen i många fall kan rymmas
            inom den tidsperiod som regeringen föreslår skall Försvarsmaktens
            ansvar vara livslångt för dem som skadar sig på något sätt inom
          </note>
          <note>
            Försvarsmaktens utlandstjänstgöring. Det här är en tydlig och
            normgivande signal till Försvarsmakten att utarbeta en väl fungerande
            och effektiv rehabiliteringsorganisation. Dessutom ger det här
            incitament för försvaret att ytterligare öka säkerheten för personalen
            i utlandsstyrkan och även förbättra färdigheterna för dem som
            vi sänder ut.

            Fru talman! Det är viktigt att den här lagen från träda i kraft
            så snart som möjligt. Det vore moraliskt fel av oss att låta ännu
            fler människor bli drabbade av att hamna mellan stolarna i olika
            försäkringssystem.
          </note>
          <note>
            Därför vill jag yrka bifall till reservation 1, för det innebär
            att vi tar fullt ansvar för de här människorna.

            Fru talman! Ärade ledamöter! Protokolläsare! Jag vill gärna instämma

            om vilken tillgång det är att ha medborgare som är beredda att
            ställa upp i olika internationella fredsfrämjande uppdrag. Det

            Den lag som nu föreligger och som vi har diskuterat i försvarsutskottet
            är ett i stort sett bra förslag som förbättrar omständigheterna
            för många. Men det finns några små brister i det.
          </note>
          <note>
            Lagens tillämpningsområde innebär en avgränsning. Det gör att
            annan personal än de som är anställda i utlandsstyrkan inte omfattas.
            Det är en brist. Det finns i och för sig inget hinder för regeringen
            att särskilt besluta att de som genomför uppdrag åt myndigheter
            eller regering också skall omfattas av samma rehabiliteringsbestämmelser
            som gäller för utlandsstyrkan och att det också skulle kunna gälla
            för andra grupper. Men det finns ingen automatik i detta.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vi i Miljöpartiet tycker att det är en brist att t.ex.

            värnpliktiga som deltar i ett riskfyllt minröjningsuppdrag inte

            Fru talman! Riksdagen skall i dag ta ställning till försvarsutskottets
            betänkande avseende lag om utlandsstyrkan inom Försvarsmakten.
            Detta ärende är av stor vikt för utskottet, eftersom det innehåller
            förbättringar av det socialrättsliga skyddet för dem som är anställda
            i utlandsstyrkan inom Försvarsmakten. För den som tjänstgör i
            en internationell fredsfrämjande verksamhet är risken att skadas
            och invalidiseras större än i många andra verksamheter.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det är ett ingående och noggrant arbete som har lagts ned vid
            beredningen av ärendet, trots att tiden begränsats av att utskottet
            strävat efter att den nya lagstiftningen skall kunna träda i kraft
            den 1 juli
          </note>
          <note>
            1999. Detta beror inte minst på den förändring av de internationella
            insatsernas karaktär som kan bli aktuell med anledning av kriget
            på Balkan.
          </note>

            Man skulle kunna tro att det här är ett dåligt förslag, men vi
            hörde just Lars Ångström säga att det faktiskt är ett bra förslag.
            Så är också fallet. Det innebär förbättringar, och det är också
            därför som vi har ansträngt oss för att snabbt bli färdiga med
            det. Hela utskottet är besjälat av en stor vilja att se till att
            de berörda får ett så gott skydd som möjligt. Det finns därför
            många fler förslag än vad som har kunnat inrymmas i lagstiftningen.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vi har dock även varit överens om att det skall bli en uppföljning,
            där vi skall kunna utvärdera de andra förslag som föreligger och
            ta ställning till om en del av dem kan införas i lagstiftningen.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vi har alltså kommit överens om att genomföra lagen så snabbt
            att den kan träda i kraft den 1 juli. Vi har dessutom föreslagit
            förbättringar i det från början i och för sig goda förslaget.
            Vi har bl.a. kommit fram till förbättringar av ersättningsnivån.
          </note>
          <note>
            Jag tycker att det här förslaget presenterats som om det inte
            skulle vara bra, men jag tycker att det är alldeles utmärkt. Jag
            är väldigt glad för att vi har kunnat komma överens om så mycket,
            men vi skall ändå följa upp en hel del i fortsättningen. Jag ser
            mycket positivt på det.

            Försvarsmaktens ansvar för rehabilitering av personer som har
            skadats under anställning i utlandsstyrkan förtydligas och förstärks.
            För att minska risken för skador hos de anställda i utlandsstyrkan
            föreslår regeringen att vissa delar av arbetsmiljölagen skall
            gälla även utomlands.
          </note>
          <note>
            Den nya lagen innehåller också viss särreglering av arbetsrättslig
            karaktär. Regeringen föreslår att vid tillämpning av lagen skall,
            om skäl talar för det, alla skador som inträffar från den första
            färden till tjänstgöringsstället och t.o.m. den sista färden därifrån
            anses som arbetsskador. Vissa begränsningar finns dock när det
            gäller semester eller ledighet utanför tjänstgöringsstället.
          </note>
          <note>
            Lagen om allmän försäkring eller lagen om statligt personskadeskydd,
            som är tillämpliga i de här sammanhangen, skall alltid användas
            så att man åberopar den lag som är mest förmånlig för den som
            det gäller.
          </note>
          <note>
            Regeringen föreslår att Försvarsmakten skall utreda rehabiliteringsbehovet,
            planera insatserna samt stödja och hjälpa den skadade att få lämplig
            arbetsträning eller utbildning. Det ligger alltså ett stort rehabiliteringsansvar
            på Försvarsmakten, utan att detta betyder att man inte kan tillgripa
            också andra åtgärder som samhället har att erbjuda i detta sammanhang.
          </note>
          <note>
            Försvarsmaktens sociala och arbetslivsinriktade rehabiliteringsansvar
            skall enligt förslaget bestå under tre år. Tiden skall dock kunna
            förlängas med ytterligare två år. Regeringen föreslår också att
            anhöriga skall kunna få ersättning från Försvarsmakten för vissa
            kostnader, eftersom anhörigas engagemang ofta är ytterst väsentligt
            för resultatet av rehabiliteringsinsatsen.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det finns också ett särskilt stöd till anhöriga som själva behöver
            stöd på grund av att de har upplevt svåra saker i sådana här sammanhang.
            Reglerna ger alltså en ganska god täckning.
          </note>
          <note>
            I motsats till den utredning som ligger till grund för förslaget
            föreslår regeringen att åtgärderna för anhöriga skall kunna överklagas
            till förvaltningsdomstol. Också detta ger ett starkt rättighetsstöd
            i sammanhanget.
          </note>
          <note>
            Som vi har tänkt kommer lagen nu att kunna träda i kraft den
            1 juli i år. De nya bestämmelserna kommer också att kunna tillämpas
            för tidigare anställda som skadats efter utgången av 1992.

            Utskottet har övervägt möjligheten att komplettera och förtydliga
            det framlagda lagförslaget på vissa punkter, men på grund av att
            vi, som jag nämnt, var oroliga för att i så fall försinka behandlingen
            föreslås i stället ett fortsatt uppföljningsarbete.
          </note>
          <note>
            Regeringen har här alltså lagt fram ett förslag om en ny lag
            inom försvarsutskottets område. Riksdagen lägger alltid stor vikt
            vid uppföljning och utvärdering av sina beslut. En uppföljning
            och utvärdering av detta ligger alltså helt i linje med riksdagens
            ansvar.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vi menar att utvärderingen skall kunna avse åtminstone de första
            fem åren.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vi har varit överens om att ge regeringen till känna det som
            utskottet skriver om denna femårsgräns.
          </note>
          <note>
            Regeringen har föreslagit att livränteunderlaget skulle bestämmas
            till minst fem basbelopp, men utskottet har varit överens om att
            om någon skadas så allvarligt under tjänstgöring i utlandsstyrkan
            att den framtida försörjningsförmågan blir allvarligt nedsatt,
            skall man kunna ge en livränta som ligger i nivå med den inkomst
            som de anställda i utlandsstyrkan har, och den motsvarar sju basbelopp.
            Utskottet har därför lagt fram förslag härom i stället. Det kan
            hända att det kommer att kosta något mer än vad regeringen har
            räknat med. Hittills har dock mycket få skadats svårt, och vi
            har därför alla ställt oss bakom detta förslag.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det är med tillfredsställelse som jag kan konstatera att utskottet
            är enigt om detta ställningstagande.

            Fru talman! Vad som först såg ut att bli en fullödig debatt mellan
            allsköns partier ser nu ut att bli en ringdans mellan mig och
            Bengt Silfverstrand, och det är inte illa.

            Vi skall i dag avhandla något så viktigt som en ny försäkringsrörelselagstiftning.
            Försäkringsbranschen är mycket intressant. Det är en dynamisk
            tillväxtmarknad, som utvecklas väldigt snabbt och som har varit
            stadd i förändring under hela 90-talet. När man talar om försäkringsbranschen
            får man använda ett begrepp som "branschglidning", något som indikerar
            att försäkringar inte är en mot andra branscher tydligt avgränsad
            enskild bransch. Försäkringsorgan ägnar sig i dag väldigt mycket
            åt att placera sparpengar, vilket ibland liknar bankverksamhet.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vi har också kunnat se en hel del fusioner där försäkrings- och
            bankmarknaden integreras på ett sätt som gör att det i dag ibland
            är lite svårt att säga vad som är specifikt just för försäkringsbranschen.
          </note>
          <note>
            Detta påverkar naturligtvis också vilken typ av lagstiftning
            som vi skall genomföra i Sveriges riksdag. Om vi har viktiga marknader
            som på det här sättet är i utveckling och det sker en branschglidning,
            är det svårt att ha branschspecifika lagstiftningar, som reser
            höga murar mot andra områden. Detta måste prägla vår syn på förändringarna
            i dagens lagstiftning.

            Propositionen som avlämnats kommer mycket sent. Det finns underlag
            i form av utredningar som har fått vänta länge på avgörande, och
            när propositionen väl har lagts fram är den sällsynt behäftad
            med ord som "skjuta upp", "titta på senare" och "utreda vidare",
            vilket gör att det avstamp som många trodde att den nya försäkringsrörelselagstiftningen
            skulle bli till stora delar har kommit att utebli. Man får nu
            fortsätta att vänta på ställningstaganden. Det gäller de viktiga
            frågor som här tas upp. Bl.a. när det gäller konsolideringsfondens
            framtid hänvisas det till fortsatta överväganden. Det hänvisas
            också till en översyn av associationsrättsliga regler, som påverkar
            väldigt mycket av det som står i propositionen. Det står också
            att man på ett mer grundläggande sätt skall se över nuvarande
            placeringsregler, och därför föreslås inga förändringar.
          </note>
          <note>
            Den fråga som kanske har varit viktigast för försäkringsbranschen
            är den s.k. femprocentsregeln. I
          </note>
          <note>
            propositionen säger man att man vill koppla ihop den med andra
            finansiella aktörer och deras ägande och att här sätter man inte
            ned foten. Vi har, som jag skall återkomma till, i stället fått
            ett domstolsutslag i EG-
          </note>
          <note>
            domstolen som har förändrat förutsättningarna.
          </note>
          <note>
            I det moderata förhållningssättet, vilket har framkommit i en
            del diskussioner som vi har haft om de finansiella marknaderna,
            kan man se två stycken skolor.
          </note>
          <note>
            Den ena är att försöka att reglera denna mycket expansiva och
            föränderliga marknad, som man kan tala om i bredare bemärkelse,
            och att inte heller då, tycker vi, stanna vid att nationellt avskärma
            Sverige med en avvikande lagstiftning trots att detta rör frågor
            som möter global öppen konkurrens.
          </note>
          <note>
            Den andra skolan, och det är väl den mer moderata, är att i stället
            utgå från att avreglera marknaderna och försöka att införa och
            uppmuntra en uppförandekodex, vilket det finns ett stort intresse
            av också hos aktörerna själva, och att uppmuntra konkurrens för
            att kunder skall få bästa möjlighet att byta och att se skillnader
            i sättet att agera.
          </note>
          <note>
            Detta präglar väldigt mycket även denna proposition. Vi har därför
            i en del reservationer kommit att landa på avvikande uppfattningar.
            Det gäller dels den s.k. konsolideringsfonden. Den av en del motsedda
            förändringen att också vinstutdelande livförsäkringsbolag skulle
            kunna få bygga upp en konsolideringsfond uteblev. Man har nu valt
            en reglering som många menar gynnar vissa aktörer på försäkringsmarknaden
            - läs s.k. ömsesidiga bolag, och det största som vi känner i den
            kategorin är naturligtvis
          </note>
          <note>
            Folksam - medan den däremot missgynnar dem som driver en vinstutdelningspolitik.
          </note>
          <note>
            Vi har försökt att ta hänsyn till att det naturligtvis skulle
            kunna föras i bevis att det finns oro för att ett vinstutdelande
            bolag som får bygga upp, konsolidera, en fond med hjälp av premier
            skulle kunna dela ut premiepengar till ägarna och att det kanske
            skulle uppfattas som stötande. Vi har därför föreslagit en variant
            där man gör klart att man först skall använda den buffert som
            ägarkapital har skjutit till innan det kan bli tal om att ta i
            anspråk premieavsatta pengar.
          </note>
          <note>
            Men vi tror att det för denna marknads fortsatta utveckling vore
            bra om en konsolideringsfond också kunde tillåtas för den typen
            av bolag som har vinstutdelande politik.

            Vad gäller femprocentsregeln fick vi ett domstolsutslag som i
            ett slag upphävde den svenska femprocentsregeln. Vi lever nu i
            något så märkligt som ett laglöst tillstånd, då det nu egentligen
            inte finns någon klar definition av vad som är s.k. försäkringsfrämmande
            ägande eller koppling till andra företag. Det är inte okomplicerat
            för ett försäkringsbolag att ha ett betydande ägaransvar i börsnoterade
            aktiebolag. Det medför en lång rad ansvarstaganden som egentligen
            inte följer av att man placerar livförsäkringspengar till för
            kunderna bästa avkastning. Vi har försökt att ge uttryck för detta
            och sagt att här måste man se hela den diskussion som förs i Sverige
            om ifall det gynnar det institutionella sparandet och att det
            är olyckligt att institutioner och utländska ägare är mer skattemässigt
            gynnade än privatpersoner som försöker äga svenska aktier i Sverige.

            Vi tycker dock att femprocentsregeln, vilket också uttrycks i
            propositionen, är otidsenlig. Den skapar dessutom en nationell
            konkurrensnackdel för Sverige på denna globala öppna marknad.
            Det vore dock intressant att i dag få någon sorts besked om vad
            som komma skall i stället. Jag har under dagen inhämtat uppgifter
            om att den till den 28 maj, alltså om två dagar, aviserade propositionen
            i ärendet inte kommer just den 28 maj men att väl en lagrådsremiss
            är på väg i början av juni för en proposition ungefär vid midsommar.
            Det är naturligtvis olyckligt att det blir en fördröjning på det
            här viset i en fråga där ju Erik
          </note>
          <note>
            Åsbrink redan för ett år sedan var ute och flaggade att denna
            femprocentsregel skulle försvinna. Nu har vi, som sagt, i stället
            hamnat i detta märkliga läge att vi faktiskt inte vet vad som
            gäller. Här vore ett besked på sin plats.

            Fru talman! Den proposition som vi nu behandlar om ändrade försäkringsregler
            är inte helt lättillgänglig. Det är komplicerade tekniska frågor.
            Jag är mot den bakgrunden inte säker på att ens två så debattglada
            personer som Fredrik Reinfeldt och undertecknad kan åstadkomma
            någon större underhållning.

            Förslagen innebär en betydande modernisering av försäkringsrörelsereglerna
            och en renodling av tillsynen för svenska försäkringsbolag. Det
            är i första hand livbolagens verksamhet som berörs, och syftet
            med förändringarna är att underlätta produktutveckling och konkurrens.
            För försäkringstagarna innebär förslaget ett ökat skydd.

          <note>
            Europa har inneburit en ökad konkurrens på den svenska marknaden.
            Av denna anledning framstår dagens regleringar när det gäller
            skälighets- och sundhetsprinciper som mindre lämpliga, eftersom
            de i påtaglig grad har hämmat nyetableringar och produktutveckling
            på området. Härigenom har konsumenternas behov av pris- och produktkonkurrens
            delvis motverkats.
          </note>
          <note>
            I propositionen föreslås nu av dessa skäl att skälighetsprincipen
            slopas och ersätts av andra skyddsregler som har till syfte att
            främja en god ekonomisk genomlysning av försäkringarna och en
            genom avtal reglerad ordning av rätten till överskott. Sundhetsprincipen
            ersätts av en tydligare handlingsregel för försäkringsbolagen
            med krav på en tillfredsställande stabilitet, god information
            om försäkringsbolag och en god försäkringsstandard på verksamheten.

            Även försäkringsbolag som bedriver konventionell försäkringsrörelse

          <note>
            För att säkerställa försäkringstagarnas avtalade rätt till överskott
            införs dock särskilda begränsningar vad gäller just vinstutdelning.
            Livbolag som bedrivit verksamhet med vinstutdelningsförbud får
            införa villkor i bolagsordningen om vinstutdelning bara under
            förutsättning att bestämda villkor till skydd för försäkringstagarna
            är uppfyllda.

            Slutligen vill jag nämna att vissa av dagens restriktioner vad
            gäller försäkringsbolagens kapitalförvaltning lättas upp. Det
            gäller bl.a. regleringar om var s.k. skuldtäckningstillgångar
            skall få finnas.

          <note>
            I reservation 1 yrkar moderaterna att skälighetsprincipen skall
            slopas även i den obligatoriska trafikförsäkringen. En försäkringstagare
            som fått tillstånd att meddela trafikförsäkring är enligt trafikskadelagen
            skyldig att på begäran meddela sådana försäkringar, s.k. kontraheringsplikt.
            För att denna kontraheringsplikt inte skall bli en skrift i vatten
            genom att försäkringsgivaren begär höga premier som i praktiken
            kringgår denna plikt, innehåller trafikförsäkringsförordningen
            regler om att premierna inte får sättas högre än vad som med erforderlig
            säkerhet svarar mot risken, med tillägg för nödvändiga kostnader
            - s.k.

            premieskälighet.
          </note>
          <note>
            Ett bifall till den här reservationen skulle även kräva andra
            justeringar av nuvarande regler om kontraheringsplikten. Detta
            måste naturligtvis prövas ytterligare med hänsyn till de särskilda
            förhållanden som råder just på trafikförsäkringsområdet och mot
            de nya avtalsrättsliga regler som nu bereds i Finansdepartementet.

            I reservation 2 hävdar moderater och kristdemokrater att regeringens
            förslag vad gäller avsättning till konsolideringsfond skapar en
            konkurrensfördel för icke vinstutdelande ömsesidiga bolag. Mot
            den bakgrunden förordar man att lagen bör stadga att ett vinstutdelande
            livförsäkringsbolag skall äga rätt att avsätta premiemedel till
            en konsolideringsfond som får användas som buffert efter det att
            de fonder som aktieägarna skapat tagits i anspråk. I reservation

          <note>
            begär Folkpartiet under samma punkt att även utdelande bolag
            skall kunna få bygga upp konsolideringsfonder.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det finns en grundläggande skillnad mellan ömsesidiga försäkringsbolag
            och försäkringsaktiebolag som är viktig att beakta i det här sammanhanget.
            I de ömsesidiga försäkringsbolagen är försäkringstagarna delägare.
            De står för riskkapitalet, men har å andra sidan som delägare
            också rätten till överskottet om rörelsen går bättre än väntat.
            I livförsäkringsaktiebolag bestämmer aktieägarna och har rätt
            till vinsten om verksamheten går bra. Då bör också aktieägarna
            stå för riskkapitalet och betala om verksamheten sköts dåligt.
            Det är orimligt med en ordning där försäkringstagarna står för
            allmänt riskkapital om rörelsen går sämre än väntat samtidigt
            som aktieägarna tar hem vinsterna om rörelsen går bättre än väntat.
          </note>
          <note>
            Det är alldeles för tidigt att, som reservanterna och motionärerna,
            här slå fast att inga vinstutdelningsbolag kommer bildas om inte
            vinstutdelande försäkringsbolag får använda försäkringstagarnas
            pengar som gratis riskkapital i en konsolideringsfond.
          </note>
          <note>
            För att vinstutdelande livförsäkringsbolag skall kunna meddela
            långa livförsäkringar, dvs. pensionsförsäkringar av samma typ
            som de traditionella icke vinstutdelande livförsäkringsbolagen
            gör i dag - det gäller såväl ömsesidiga bolag som aktiebolag -
            krävs visserligen ett stort och betryggande riskkapital. Detta
            är emellertid inte i sak annorlunda än att annan kapitalintensiv
            verksamhet kräver kapitalstarka och uthålliga ägare. Om aktieägarna
            inte är beredda att skjuta till det kapital som behövs bör de
            satsa pengar på annat. De bör alltså inte subventioneras av försäkringstagarna.

            Moderaterna, Kristdemokraterna och Folkpartiet anser att nu gällande
            placeringsbegränsningar i livförsäkringsbolag vad avser innehav
            i publika bolag och fastigheter bör avskaffas för tillgångar som
            svarar mot återbäring. Man anser vidare att s.k. derivatinstrument
            bör få användas för hantering av livförsäkringsbolagens skuldsida
            i balansräkningen.
          </note>
          <note>
            Reformeringen av rörelsereglerna innebär stora förändringar på
            kort tid. Det är svårt att förutse effekterna av en höjning av
            dagens tillgångsgränser i den nya ordningen. Friare placeringsregler
            gäller för villkorad återbäring. För villkorad återbäring gäller
            inte gränsen på 25 %. Regeringen har här aviserat en bred översyn
            av placeringsreglerna. Justeringar av dagens placeringsgränser
            och möjligheterna att använda derivatinstrument för att hantera
            risker på skuldsidan kommer att behandlas i denna översyn. Då
            är det enligt vår mening ganska logiskt att erfarenheterna från
            tillämpningen av de nya rörelsereglerna för försäkringsbolagen
            får avvaktas i dessa frågor.

            Reservation 5 är en borgerlig fyrpartireservation. I
          </note>
          <note>
            den yrkas att den s.k. femprocentsregeln bör förändras. Den regeln
            innebär att svenska försäkringsbolag utan Finansinspektionens
            medgivande inte får äga mer än 5 % av rösterna i samma aktiebolag.
            Eftersom en proposition i frågan med anpassning till åberopad
            dom i EG-domstolen är nära förestående finns det ingen anledning
            att nu föregripa denna fråga. Det kan inte ha någon betydelse
            om den kommer i morgon, om en vecka eller om 14 dagar.

            Den fråga som Moderaterna, Kristdemokraterna och Folkpartiet
            tar upp i reservation 6 är en gammal bekanting. Den handlar om
            de borgerliga partiernas ständiga behov att ondgöra sig över att
            individer i samverkan - det är det som är kollektiv - skaffar
            sig förmånliga regler för gruppförsäkringar, t.ex. hemförsäkringar.
            Men den frågan behandlas inte i propositionen. Flertalet av de
            av reservanterna här upptagna frågorna rör avtalsrättsliga frågeställningar
            som i första hand bör prövas inom ramen för en ny försäkringsavtalslagstiftning
            och inte föregripas nu.
          </note>
          <note>
            Rent allmänt kan man ändå ifrågasätta varför man i lagstiftningen
            skall införa särskilda bestämmelser som förhindrar just fackliga
            intresseorganisationer att träffa fördelaktiga försäkringsavtal
            för sina medlemmar. Det handlar om försäkringar som är till stor
            hjälp för många medlemmar den dag som t.ex. en brand eller annan
            skada inträffar. I många andra sammanhang tecknas ju också kollektiva
            försäkringar, t.ex. av varuhus, idrottsanläggningar eller föreningar.
            Dessa försäkringar gäller för besökare i allmänhet eller för medlemmarnas
            räkning, t.ex. för olycksfall, trots att de personer som skyddas
            av försäkringarna i vissa fall kan ha andra olycksfallsförsäkringar.
          </note>
          <note>
            Särförhållanden hos sådana försäkringar kan och bör beaktas inom
            ramen för de allmänna försäkringsrörelseregler som finns. De bör
            bedömas efter samma principer som andra kollektiva försäkringar
            och inte först och främst med hänsyn till om försäkringen köps
            av en facklig organisation. Det bör inte införas några särskilda
            rörelse- eller tillsynsregler för försäkringsverksamhet som gäller
            kollektiva försäkringar som tecknats av fackliga organisationer.
          </note>
          <note>
            I reservation 7 anser moderater och kristdemokrater att ett framtida
            regelverk bör tillåta utvecklingen av livförsäkringsprodukter
            där flyttningar möjliggörs utan skattekonsekvenser. Redan i dag
            finns det emellertid livförsäkringssparande som kan flyttas utan
            skattekonsekvenser, t.ex. fondlivförsäkringar och individuellt
            pensionssparande. De nya rörelsereglerna öppnar även för nya slag
            av traditionella livförsäkringsprodukter där en flyttningsrätt
            är avtalad och förutsatt redan vid avtalets ingående.
          </note>
          <note>
            I propositionen klargörs även skattereglerna just för att säkerställa
            att också traditionella livförsäkringar kan flyttas utan skattekonsekvenser.
            Det sägs i propositionen att man skall överväga vidare om flyttning
            kan ske inte bara mellan olika försäkringsbolag utan även mellan
            pensionssparande i bank och försäkringsbolag. Vi kan konstatera
            att reservanterna faktiskt i sak är tillgodosedda genom förslagen
            i propositionen.

            Kritiken handlar ju om när kollektiva sakförsäkringar upphandlas
            för stora grupper utan individuell anslutning. Dessutom lämnar
            upphandlingsförfarandet mycket övrigt att önska. Vi menar att

            När den borgerliga oppositionen i stället kommer med ganska klarläggande

            om vad regeringen egentligen har föreslagit. Det är väl i och
            för sig trevligt att vi får långa debatter om vad Moderaterna
            har skrivit i olika motioner. Men det hade kanske varit mer klarläggande

            det gäller de ömsesidiga bolagens konkurrensfördel som följer
            av detta lagförslag. Jag tycker att det är mycket olyckligt. Vi
            har faktiskt ansträngt oss för att försöka hitta en mellanväg
            som tar hänsyn till det Bengt Silfverstrand nämner, nämligen risken
            eller oron för att premiepengar används för att delas ut till
            aktieägare. Vi tycker att vi har funnit en form som bättre skulle
            balansera konkurrensen på en marknad där nu en mycket tydlig fördel
            skapas för bolag som Folksam. Jag vill återigen ställa frågan
            om inte Bengt Silfverstrand kan se nackdelarna med detta.

            Det vore också intressant att få höra varför man väljer att ha
            kvar placeringsregler som på många sätt är otidsenliga och skapar
            konkurrensnackdelar. Regeringen slår inte heller här fast att
            man tänker ha kvar dessa regler för evigt. Det skall ske en översyn
            och man skall återkomma i frågan senare.

            Fru talman! Förändringarna i försäkringsrörelsereglerna är mycket
            omfattande. Det rör sig om kraftiga förändringar av lagstiftningen,
            på många punkter en påtaglig modernisering. Därmed har regeringen
            visat att man vill gå ganska långt på detta område. Att man inte

            När det gäller den kollektiva hemförsäkringen är det samma argument
            som förs fram ständigt. Det är en ringaktning av ett system som
            innebär mycket stora ekonomiska fördelar och riskspridning för
            grupper som annars skulle stå oskyddade. Det är grunden för det
            kollektiva skyddet. Det tycker vi är värt att slå vakt om. Det
            finns ingen anledning att ingripa. Det finns en reservationsrätt.
            Den som inte vill vara med har den möjligheten.

            När det gäller konsolideringsfonden i vinstutdelande livförsäkringsbolag
            är det viktigt att klargöra att det är stor skillnad mellan olika
            typer av bolag. Det finns ingen anledning att försäkringstagarna
            skall stå för riskerna i svåra situationer, när bolagen går med
            förlust, och att aktieägarna sedan skall plocka hem vinsterna
            när det går bra. Det måste finnas en klar distinktion.

            Fru talman! Det är riktigt att en hel del förändringar föreslås.
            Som jag nämnde i min inledning bygger de på utredningar som har
            jobbat under lång tid. Det har varit väl känt att många av förändringarna
            skall komma. De har också mottagits väl av försäkringsbranschen.

            områdena väljer att inte ge besked eller gräva ned frågor i utredningar.

            en proposition. Vi får väl ta den diskussionen då. Men det är
            olyckligt att vi har hamnat i detta läge.

            Det viktiga är att ligga i framkant och möta den nya tidens krav,
            för att få försäkringsbranschen att växa och bli starkare. Det
            kan leda till fler jobb och att vi får en intressant marknad med
            försäkringsprodukter som förstärker konsumenternas möjligheter
            att välja. Det är det vi har sett framför oss.

            Risken med avgränsningen av konsolideringsfonden är att vinstutdelande
            bolag kommer att dra öronen åt sig och inte utveckla en del av
            de produkter de annars skulle utvecklat. Det har talats om att
            det inte blir samma goda tillgång till riskkapital i de små och
            medelstora företagen, som en följd av att man inte gick hela vägen.
            Man borde ha varit mer lyhörd för det när man valde att lagstifta.

            Fru talman! Att underlätta produktutveckling, ge bättre förutsättningar
            för konkurrens och avreglering borde låta som skön musik för en
            moderat. Här görs dessutom en mycket långtgående avreglering av
            försäkringsrörelsereglerna. Det finns en liten bit kvar.

            Det görs en distinktion mellan utdelande och icke utdelande bolag.
            Det finns ingen anledning att i panik införa nya regler för att
            åstadkomma en skenbar konkurrensneutralitet. Vinstutdelande bolag
            och icke vinstutdelande bolag drivs under helt olika förutsättningar.
            Det är en uppenbar risk att pengar slussas över från försäkringstagare
            till aktieägare på ett olämpligt sätt. Det inser man också i en
            moderatmotion. Då är det bättre att avvakta den översyn som aviseras
            inom Finansdepartementet om bl.a. konsolideringsfondens framtid.
