            feel that they are justified in taking the law into their own

            Your constituents understand, I believe, how important it is
            for a global society to have shared norms and values, codified
            in a framework of international law - just as a national community
            can only survive so long as its members agree on certain core
            values which are reflected in domestic law. Without shared values,
            without agreed norms it is very difficult to hold a community
            together. This in my judgement applies to the international level
            and what we call the international community.

              görs i betänkandet Sveriges säkerhetspolitik. Men det finns nyansskillnader
              och i en del fall meningsmotsättningar. Framför allt kanske de
              handlar om det som inte står i betänkandet och som är mest aktuellt

              Karl-Göran Biörsmark frågade vilka alternativ vi ser till den
              konflikthantering som Nato står för. För det första menar vi att
              den enda legitima organisation som har rätten att ingripa i mellanstatliga
              och inomstatliga konflikter är Förenta nationerna. Det kan ske
              genom andra organisationer, om det sker på uppdrag av FN, av ett

              till ett förslag till avtal i Rambouillet, hade det uppenbara
              syftet att inte få någon lösning till stånd. Den fredsprocessen

              Det är viktigt att man också är med där andra länder är med.
              Man kan ju inte bygga upp ett samarbete bara med sig själv; man

              Herr talman! Viola Furubjelke sade i någon sorts polemik mot
              mig att konflikter på Balkan inte innebär något militärt hot mot
              Sverige. Det har jag inga problem med. Jag har aldrig sagt att
              det är så och har heller aldrig polemiserat mot någon annan uppfattning.
              Däremot sade jag att jag har svårt att instämma i utrikesministerns
              uttalande om att Sveriges säkerhetspolitiska läge inte påverkas
              av kriget på Balkan.

              denna avvaktande attityd till ett avtal som begränsar militär
              upprustning. Jag tycker att det förhållningssättet står i bjärt
              kontrast till hur tidigare socialdemokratiska regeringar har förhållit
              sig till nedrustningsavtal. När Viola Furubjelke säger att det
              är att slå in öppna dörrar att föreslå detta förstår jag inte
              varför vi inte kan ansöka om att få bli en del av detta avtal
              redan i dag. Jag hoppas bara att andra länder inte följer Sveriges
              exempel, att inta den här avvaktande attityden.

              Herr talman! Jag är mycket väl medveten om att det här inte är
              rätt tillfälle för synpunkter på budgeten, men jag tycker ändå
              att platsen är ganska väl vald för att uttrycka ett litet önskemål.
              Jag är naturligtvis hundraprocentigt för den överenskommelse som
              har träffats mellan Centern och Socialdemokraterna om försvaret,
              en uppgörelse som i sin snara förlängning syftar bl.a. till att
              Sverige skall ha en större beredskap för insatser av internationell
              karaktär, men jag vill ändå ge uttryck för en önskan. Av de många
              miljarder som kan sparas på försvaret skulle åtminstone några
              miljoner kunna tillföras OSSE, som en välbehövlig förstärkning
              och ett erkännande av de insatser som görs. Det skulle också ligga
              en viss värdefull symbolik i det.

              beslut som handlar om säkrare kemikaliehantering och kontroll,

            som godkändes av riksdagen 1998. Den särskilda uppräkningen av
            anslaget för anskaffning av materiel med den s.k. teknikfaktorn
            skall upphöra fr.o.m. år 2000.

              man med att det tar upp till tusen år att befria de här människorna
              och dessa länder från det ok som mineringen innebär. Sverige besitter
              i dag en unik kompetens, en unik teknik, när det gäller minröjning.
              Regeringen säger också att det här skall vara en prioriterad del

              som behövs för ett försvar som har en defensiv strategi som sin

              Det är ju inte min tolkning som är det viktiga. Det viktiga är
              hur landet Sydafrika tolkade det hela. Försvarsministern och presidenten

              frågan vad svenska staten tjänar på att sälja JAS Gripen. Den
              kanske viktigaste vinsten är att vi kan dra ut på takten i våra

              Fru talman! De flesta bedömare anser att ett invasionshot mot
              Sverige för närvarande inte är överhängande. Regeringen anser
              inte heller att ett invasionshot skulle kunna utvecklas under

              Fru talman! Juholt har säker läst denna också, nämligen Förändrad
              omvärld - omdanat försvar, rapport från Försvarsberedningen inför
              1999 års kontrollstation. Där är man mycket tydlig när det gäller
              anpassningen. Man skriver: Tanken bakom anpassningsfilosofin för
              försvaret är att tidiga signaler rörande förändringar i vår säkerhetspolitiska
              situation skall kunna upptäckas i så god tid att vi står väl rustade
              när förändringarna har inträffat. Det torde inte vara lätt att
              få denna filosofi att fungera i det praktiska arbetet. Det finns
              internationellt många exempel på att förvarningssignalerna inte
              har uppfattats eller att man inte har tagit hänsyn till dem.

              Fru talman! I betänkandet på s. 32 och 33 skissas den här modellen
              väldigt detaljerat. Bl.a. står det att anpassningsförmågan skall
              förbättras genom utvecklad underrättelsetjänst och utvecklat kunnande
              om olika typer av hot och hur de skall mötas. Man skall utarbeta
              femåriga planer för anpassningsåtgärder, vidta åtgärder för att
              reducera bindningar i materiel och personal, främja materielförsörjningen

              ansåg vi inte att det var tillräckligt. Det är inte orimligt att
              tänka sig att den skadade har behov av en mycket längre rehabiliteringstid,
              även om det kan räcka med den här tiden för de flesta, men att
              Försvarsmakten anser att det räcker med tre plus två år, dvs.
              fem år, som är inskrivet. Det skulle då kunna uppkomma en konflikt

              Och vi vet hur det brukar bli i sådana här sammanhang. Det är

              en mängd olika förslag för att förbättra de anhörigas möjligheter.
              Det gäller i första hand ersättningen för de anhöriga. Det är

              vidare, att jobba på. Men det här har också en stor betydelse

              Vi skall i dag avhandla något så viktigt som en ny försäkringsrörelselagstiftning.
              Försäkringsbranschen är mycket intressant. Det är en dynamisk
              tillväxtmarknad, som utvecklas väldigt snabbt och som har varit
              stadd i förändring under hela 90-talet. När man talar om försäkringsbranschen
              får man använda ett begrepp som "branschglidning", något som indikerar
              att försäkringar inte är en mot andra branscher tydligt avgränsad
              enskild bransch. Försäkringsorgan ägnar sig i dag väldigt mycket
              åt att placera sparpengar, vilket ibland liknar bankverksamhet.

              Jag förstår att Bengt Silfverstrand inte ser några problem när
              det gäller de ömsesidiga bolagens konkurrensfördel som följer
              av detta lagförslag. Jag tycker att det är mycket olyckligt. Vi
              har faktiskt ansträngt oss för att försöka hitta en mellanväg
              som tar hänsyn till det Bengt Silfverstrand nämner, nämligen risken
              eller oron för att premiepengar används för att delas ut till
              aktieägare. Vi tycker att vi har funnit en form som bättre skulle
              balansera konkurrensen på en marknad där nu en mycket tydlig fördel
              skapas för bolag som Folksam. Jag vill återigen ställa frågan
              om inte Bengt Silfverstrand kan se nackdelarna med detta.

              Fru talman! Förändringarna i försäkringsrörelsereglerna är mycket
