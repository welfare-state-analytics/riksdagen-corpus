- [A Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1C3e2gwi9z83ikXbYXNPfB6RF7spTgzxA?usp=sharing) that demonstrates how the dataset can be used with Python

## Basic use

A full dataset is available under the zip download on this page. The unzipped folder is structured in  the following manner
